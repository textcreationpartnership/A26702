            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CAUSES &amp; CURE OF THE Peſtilence.</head>
            <p>THe firſt Sin which I ſhall inſiſt upon, ſo highly provoking unto the Lord, to ſend the deſtroying Peſtilence among a people, is the ſin of <hi>Oppreſſion:</hi> When the Supream Powers and Authorities of a Nation, do exerciſe a Uſurpation or Oppeſſion over the Bodies and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of the people of God. This was the ſin of <hi>Pharoah,</hi> who tyrannized, not onely over the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but over the Conſciences alſo, of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> He ſets Task-maſters over them, to afflict them with their burdens; And the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> made the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſerve with ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, and made their lives bitter with hard bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, in Morter and in Brick, and in all manner of ſervice in the field; all their ſervice wherein they made them ſerve, was with rigour. By rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of which bondage, the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſighed and cryed, and their cry came up unto God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.11, 13, 14. comp. with <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.23. So <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.7. <hi>The Lord ſaid, I have ſurely ſeen the afflictien of my people which are it</hi> Egypt, <hi>and have heard their
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66159:3"/>
cry, by reaſon of their Task-maſters, for I know their ſorrows;</hi> And in the 9th. <hi>Verſe. Behold the cry of the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>is come up unto me; and I have alſo ſeen the Oppreſſion wherewith the</hi> Egyptians <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them.</hi> This was an oppreſſion that <hi>Pharoah</hi> and his cruel Task-maſters did exerciſe over their bodies.</p>
            <p>The oppreſſion that he exerciſed over their ſouls and conſciences, did evidently appear in this. The Lord he called, and commiſſionated <hi>Moſes</hi> to go unto <hi>Pharoah,</hi> and he with the Elders of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> were to ſay unto him; <hi>The Lord God of the</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews <hi>hath met with us, and now let us go (we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee) three days journey into the Wilderneſs, that we may ſacrifice unto the Lord our God,</hi> Exod. 3.18. This they often preſt upon him: And the reaſon wherefore they ſo much urged it is very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, in the 3d. <hi>Verſ.</hi> of the 5th. <hi>Chap. Let us go we pray thee three days journey into the Deſart, and ſacrifice unto the Lord our God, leſt he fall upon us with Peſtilence, or with the Sword;</hi> That is, Leſt he ſlay us and deſtroy us with Peſtilence, and with the Sword, as in <hi>Judges</hi> 8.21. <hi>Pharoah</hi> he hardens his heart, and is diſobedient unto the word of the Lord. And <hi>Pharoah</hi> ſaid, who is the Lord, that I ſhould obey his voice, to let <hi>Iſrael</hi> go? I know not the Lord, neither will I let <hi>Iſrael</hi> go. They be idle (ſaith he) therefore they cry, ſaying; <hi>Let us go and Sacrifice unto our God,</hi> Exod. 5.2, 8, 17. But the Judgments of God purſuing him at the very heels, and the greivous ſwarm of Flies coming into his houſe, and into his ſervants houſes, and into all the Land of <hi>Egypt;</hi> ſo that the Land
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:66159:3"/>
was corrupted by reaſon of the ſwarm of Flies: then he calls for <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> that they might go and Sacrifice to God; but where? in the Land, that is, in his own Land, the Land of <hi>Egypt.</hi> But what ſaid <hi>Moſes? It is not meet ſo to do, for we ſhall ſacrifice the abominations of the</hi> Egyptians <hi>to the Lord our God; Lo, ſhall we Sacrifice the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the</hi> Egyptians <hi>before their eyes, and will they not ſtone us? We will go three days journey into the Wilderneſs, and Sacrifice unto the Lord our God, as he ſhall command us.</hi> It is not meet, or it is not right ſo to do, as being not ſo appointed of God, who called into the Wilderneſs to Sacrifice, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Shall we Sacrifice the abominations of the</hi> Egyptians? That is, <hi>The Beaſts which the</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians <hi>do worſhip, and do abhor to kill, or to ſee killed for Sacrifice.</hi> And the Sentence twice repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, may imply two ſenſes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Shall we Sacrifice to our God, ſuch things as the <hi>Egyptians</hi> Sacrifice, that would be an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the Lord?</p>
            <p>Or, 2. Shall we Sacrifice ſuch things as God requireth, that would be an abomination to the <hi>Egyptians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Scripture often calling the Gods and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of the Heathens, Abominations; As <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.25. <hi>and</hi> 12.30, 31. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23.13. <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.1. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.19. Now the principal Sacrifices of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> were Oxen and Sheep, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.9. And all Shepherds, or Sheep-keepers were an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> Gen. 46.34. For the <hi>Egyptians</hi> abſtained from Sheep, and Sacrificed Goats. By all which it is very evident, that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66159:4"/>
               <hi>Pharoah</hi> denying the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to Worſhip, as God had appointed them, did oppreſs them, not only in their bodies, but in their Conſciences like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; which drew down the dreadful Judgments of God upon him and his Land; among which; this of the deſtroying Peſtilence. For proof whereof, ſee <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.19, 20. <hi>I am ſure</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>that the King of</hi> Egypt <hi>will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand</hi> And what follows? <hi>I will ſtretch out my hand and ſmite</hi> Egypt <hi>with all my wonders, &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Exod</hi> 9.13, 14, 15. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God of the</hi> Hebrews, <hi>Let my people go, that they may ſerve me; for I will at this time ſend all my plagues upon thy heart, &amp;c.</hi> and eſpecially in the 15. <hi>Verſ. For now will I ſtretch out my hand, that I may ſmite thee and thy people with Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and thou ſhalt be cut off from the Earth.</hi> And in the 12. <hi>Chap.</hi> and 29. <hi>Verſ.</hi> See what a dreadful ſlaughter the Lord made accordingly in the Land of <hi>Egypt. And it came to paſs, that at Mid-night the Lord ſmote all the firſt-born in the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>from the firſt-born of</hi> Pharoah <hi>that ſat on his Throne, unto the firſt-born of the Captive that was in the Dungeon, and all the firſt-born of Cattel; and there was a great cry in</hi> Egypt, <hi>for there was not a Houſe where there was not one dead.</hi> See further the ſeverity of God in puniſhing this ſin of <hi>Oppreſſion,</hi> Jer. 34.17. <hi>Therefore, thus ſaith the Lord, ye have not hearkened unto me in proclaiming liberty every one to his brother, and every man to his neighbour; Behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, ſaith the Lord, to the Sword, to the Peſtilence, and to the Famine, and I will make
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66159:4"/>
you to be removed into all the Kingdoms of the earth.</hi> So highly diſpleaſing it is unto the Lord, for a people to be oppreſſed, either in their civil or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual liberties and enjoyments, according to that in <hi>Pſa.</hi> 12.5. <hi>For the oppreſſion of the poor, for the ſighing of the needy, now will I ariſe (ſaith the Lord) I will ſet him at ſafety from him that puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feth at him.</hi> And further, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.25, 26. A dreadful place to all cruel Oppreſſors of Gods people; ſaith the Lord there, <hi>I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will ſave thy Children; And I will feed them that oppreſs thee, with their own fleſh, and they ſhall be drunken with their own blood, as with ſweet wine;</hi> And <hi>Amos</hi> 2.6. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, for three tranſgreſſions of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and for four, I will not turn away the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof;</hi> Why? <hi>Becauſe they ſold the righteous for ſilver, and the poor for a pair of ſhoes.</hi> So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.4, 5, 6. <hi>Thus (ſaith the Lord) my people went down aforetime into</hi> Egypt <hi>to ſojourn there, and the</hi> Aſſyrian <hi>oppreſſed them without cauſe; Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what have I here, (ſaith the Lord) that my people is taken away for nought? they that rule over them, make them to bowl, (ſaith the Lord) and my name continually every day is blaſphemed. Therefore my people ſhall know my name, therefore they ſhall know in that day, that I am he that doth ſpeak, behold it is I.</hi> By which it is very evident that the Lord does not onely intimate unto us, how ſorely he plagued the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> becauſe they had grievouſly afflicted and oppreſſed his people, which voluntarily, and of their own accord went down into <hi>Egypt,</hi> but alſo that he will much more grievouſly plague the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66159:5"/>
               <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> that carried them away out of their own Land, the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which he had given them for an Inheritance, and there dealt ſo cruelly and unmercifully with them.</p>
            <p>So ſorely diſpleaſing is it unto the Lord, when thoſe that rule over his people, ſhall make them to howl; that is, to cry bitterly, to mourn and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo ely, as it is rendred, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.8. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 21.12. To this agrees that in the 50th. <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and the 33, and 34. <hi>Verſes. Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts. The Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and the Children of</hi> Judah <hi>were oppreſſed together, and all that took them Captives held them faſt, they refuſed to let them go. Their Redeemer is ſtrong, the Lord of Hoſts is his name, he ſhall throughly plead their cauſe, that he may give reſt unto the Land, and diſquiet the Inhabitants of</hi> Babylon. What we may underſtand by the Lords pleading of the cauſe of his people here, and diſquieting the inhabitants of <hi>Babylon</hi> that oppreſſed them, that of <hi>Jerem.</hi> 51.35, 36. doth evidently declare. <hi>The violence done to me and to my fleſh, be upon</hi> Babylon <hi>ſhall the Inhabitants of</hi> Sion <hi>ſay, and my blood upon the Inhabitants of</hi> Chaldea, <hi>ſhall</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>ſay. Therefore thus ſaith the Lord, behold I will plead thy cauſe, and take vengeance for thee, and I will dry up her Sea, and make her Springs dry.</hi> When the Lord ſhall plead the cauſe of <hi>Sion,</hi> then will he take vengeance for her, that is, he will avenge himſelf of his and her cruel oppreſſing enemies; According to that which the Lord of Hoſts, the mighty one of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſpeaks in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.24. <hi>Ah, I will eaſe me of mine Adverſaries, and avenge me of mine Enemies.</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:66159:5"/>
This is the time when he will make his Arrows drunk with blood, and his Sword to devour fleſh. And then what follows? <hi>Rejoyce O ye Nations, with his people: for he will avenge the blood of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and will render vengeance unto his Adverſaries, and will be merciful unto his Land, and to his people;</hi> As it is in <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.42, 43. This is that time which is called by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, The day of the Lords vengeance, and the year of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes for the controverſies of</hi> Sion, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 34.8. called by <hi>Jeremiah, the vengeance of the Lord our God, the vengeance of his Temple, Jer.</hi> 50.28. And take notice then how ſevere the Lord will be. He tells us, that his Sword ſhall be bathed in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and it ſhall come down upon <hi>Idumea,</hi> and upon the people of his curſe to Judgement. By <hi>Idumea,</hi> we are to underſtand <hi>Edom,</hi> or the <hi>Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> who were the higheſt Kindred of the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> but notwithſtanding they were their greateſt enemies and oppreſſors; And therefore ſaid the Lord, by the Prophet <hi>Obadiah, Verſ.</hi> 10. <hi>For thy violence</hi> (meaning the <hi>Edomites) againſt thy Brother</hi> Jacob, <hi>ſhame ſhall cover thee, and thou ſhalt be cut off for ever.</hi> And theſe are a Type and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of all the enemies of the Church of God, who indeed do boaſt and brag that they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended and born of the Church, crying up the Temple of the Lord, The Temple of the Lord, ſetting up a Worſhip of their own deviſing, and are in the practiſe of Sacraments and Ordinances, as the true Church and Spouſe of Chriſt, yet, indeed, and in truth, do hate, perſecute, and oppreſs the true ſpiritual and ſincere worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers

of Jeſus. Whereby it is very evident, what dreadful plagues and puniſhments the ſin of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion doth bring upon a Land and Nation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond Peſtilential ſin, is the ſin of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution,</hi> and <hi>hatred againſt God and his people:</hi> As God hath his Arrows of his deliverance for the preſervation of his people againſt their enemies, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 13.17. So he hath the Arrows of his Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and wrath, which <hi>Job</hi> being under a ſpirit of deſertion and temptation apprehended were within him, the poiſon whereof he ſaid did drink up his ſpirit, <hi>Job</hi> 6.4. So <hi>David</hi> in the like condition, <hi>That the arrows of the Lord did ſtick faſt in him, and his hand preſſed him ſore,</hi> Pſal. 38.2. And the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> in his <hi>Lamentations; He hath bent his bow</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and ſet me as a mark for the Arrow. He hath cauſed the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins,</hi> Lam. 3.12, 13. I ſay whatever might be the apprehenſions of theſe holy and righteous men, yet ſurely the Lord has his arrows of his ſore diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and wrath, which as the inſtruments of death, he hath prepared and ordained againſt the <hi>Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> Pſal. 7.13. And this of the deſtroying Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence is one of the ſoreſt and ſharpeſt of them, as reckoned amongſt his four ſore judgements, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.21. And as the wicked <hi>do bend their bow, and make ready their arrows upon the ſtring, that they may privily ſhoot at the upright in heart,</hi> Pſal. 11.2. So the Lord he has his bow and arrows, and his Bow is bent alſo, and his arrows he hath ready, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 7.12. which he ſends out and ſcatters his enemies with, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.14. With theſe he breaks their bones and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:66159:6"/>
pierces them through, <hi>Num.</hi> 24.8. yea, makes them drunk with their blood, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.42. Theſe are ſharp in the heart of the Kings enemies, Pſal. 45.5. The Inſtruments and means that the Lord makes uſe of againſt his enemies are piercing, yea ſo piercing, that the heart, the cloſeſt and ſtrongeſt part, even that wherein life conſiſteth, ſhall be peirced thereby. The arrows of the Lord are like the ſwords of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi> which did execution and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not empty, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.22. You think by flying away and hiding your ſelves in the thickets of the forreſt, you ſhall be ſecured from the ſtroke of theſe arrows of Gods vengeance; but know, if you are Gods Enemies and perſecutors, his <hi>hand will find you out, yea his right hand will finde out thoſe that hate him; and he will make you as a fiery oven in the time of his anger,</hi> Pſal. 21.8, 9. <hi>For wickedneſs burneth as fire, and it ſhall devour the briars and thorns, and ſhall kindle in the thickets of the forreſt, and they ſhall mount up as the lifting up of ſmoke; for through the wrath of the Lord of Hoſts the land ſhall be darkned, and the people ſhall be as the fewel of the fire, no man ſhall ſpare his brother,</hi> Iſa. 9.18, 19. I ſay, if you be the Lords Adverſaries, then if the Scriptures be true and cannot be broken, you ſhall aſſuredly be broken in peices, yea out of heaven will the Lord thunder upon you, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.10. And if that will not do, he will throw you into the deeps, as a ſtone into the mighty waters, as he dealt with the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors of his people, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.12. I cannot let paſs thoſe dreadful imprecations which the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> thundereth out againſt his and the Lords Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, under the perſon of <hi>Judas;</hi> Set a wicked

man over him (ſaith he) Let Satan ſtand at his right hand; let him be condemned and his prayer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſin, and his days few, and his children fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs, and vagabonds, begging their bread; and ſuch like prophetical direful wiſhes; And why all this? <hi>Becauſe that he remembred not to ſhew mercy, but perſecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even ſlay the broken in heart,</hi> Pſa. 109. to ver. 17. ſo Pſa. 69. verſe 22. and onward; <hi>Let their table become a ſnare before them, and that which ſhould have been for their welfare, let it become a trap: Let their eyes be dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that they ſee not, and make their loins continually to ſhake. Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them. Let their habitations be deſolate, and let none dwell in their tents. Add iniquity to their iniquity, and let them not come unto thy righteouſneſs: Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi> Now what's the reaſon that <hi>David</hi> devoteth his and the Lords enemies to ſuch dreadful deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions? why? even for this cauſe; <hi>For they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute him whom thou haſt ſmitten, and talk to the grief of thoſe whom thou haſt wounded.</hi> By all which he meaneth, that the wicked laid grievous afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and puniſhments upon ſuch, whom the Lord in his fatherly love had chaſtiſed, whether you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it of Chriſt or of his afflicted and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted members: This is a ſin that is highly provoking unto the Lord, drawing down the wrath of God to a Kingdoms inevitable deſolation and deſtruction; as upon <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.15, 16. where it is ſaid, That <hi>the Lord God of their fathers ſent to them by his meſſengers,</hi> or prophets, <hi>riſing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:66159:7"/>
up betimes and ſending, becauſe he had compaſſion on his people, and on his dwelling place. But they mocked the meſsengers of God, and deſpiſed his words, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed his Prophets, untill the wrath of the Lord aroſe againſt his people, till there was no remedy,</hi> or no heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; becauſe on the one ſide the people repented not, and on the other ſide Gods Juſtice required that their impenitency ſhould be moſt ſeverely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. Its a ſimilitude taken from ſick bodies that are incurable; <hi>For</hi> (as <hi>Stephen</hi> ſaid truly, whom they ſtoned) <hi>which of the Prophets have not your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers perſecuted? and they have ſlain them which ſhewed before of the coming of the Juſt one</hi> (meaning Chriſt) <hi>of whom</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ye have been now the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayers and murderers,</hi> Acts 7.52. And therefore it was that our bleſſed Saviour took up that ſad la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation and complaint; <hi>O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, thou that killeſt the Prophets, and ſtoneſt them which are ſent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not?</hi> And what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows? <hi>Behold your houſe is left unto you deſolate,</hi> Matth. 23.37, 38. Perſecution is the certain fore-runner of a Nations deſolation and deſtruction. And God does uſually retaliate the ſin of perſecuting and deſtroying men upon their own heads; <hi>Let their way be dark and ſlippery, and let the Angel of the Lord perſecute them,</hi> Pſal. 35.6. <hi>As the fire burneth the wood, and as the flame ſetteth the mountains on fire, ſo perſecute them with thy tempeſt, and make them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid with thy ſtorm: Fill their faces with ſhame that they may ſeek thy name: O Lord, let them be confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and troubled for ever, yea let them be put to ſhame
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:66159:8"/>
and periſh: That men may know, that thou, whoſe name alone is Jehovah, art the moſt high over all the earth,</hi> Pſal. 83.15, 16, 17, 18. And who are they whom the Pſalmiſt imprecates theſe dreadful judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to fall upon, but Gods Enemies and Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors? <hi>For lo, thine enemies make a tumult, and they that hate thee have lift up the head, they have taken crafty counſel againſt thy people, and conſulted againſt thy hidden ones. They have ſaid, Come, let us cut them off from being a Nation; that the name of</hi> Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el <hi>may be no more in remembrance.</hi> God has his hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ones, ſuch whoſe life is hid with Chriſt in God, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.3. whom the Lord eſteems as his jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, keeping them in faithful and ſafe cuſtody, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them in the ſecret of his preſence from the pride of man, which betake themſelves to the Lord for refuge to be hid and ſecure under his tuition and protection, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.5. and 31.20. And theſe are they that the enemies of God did conſult and conſpire againſt, even to extirpate them, and to root them out of the land. But ſee how juſt the Lord is in the exeution of his righteous and terrible judgements upon ſuch: <hi>Thou ſhalt take up this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>againſt the King of</hi> Babylon <hi>and ſay, How hath the Oppreſſor ceaſed? the golden City ceaſed? the Lord hath broken the ſtaff of the wicked, and the Scepter of the Rulers. He that ſmote the people in wrath with a continual ſtroke</hi> (mark that) <hi>he that ruled the Nations in anger is perſecuted, and none hindereth,</hi> Iſa. 14.4, 5, 6. O that this were ſeriouſly laid to heart by the perſecuting ſpirits of this generation; whether Gods controverſie with the Kingdom at this time, in this ſore viſitation
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:66159:8"/>
of the Plague among us, doth not in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſpring from this evil and bitter root; ſo hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and provoking ſin it is unto the Lord.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third peſtilential deſtroying ſin, is the ſin of <hi>Murder</hi> and <hi>Blood-ſhed</hi> that is exerciſed upon the people of God. See <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.11, 12 13. the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful threatnings of the Lord againſt <hi>Babylon</hi> for this very ſin: <hi>Becauſe ye were glad</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ye rejoyced, O ye deſtroyers of mine heritage, becauſe ye aro grown fat as the heifer at graſs, and bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low as bulls:</hi> Mark, they were the deſtroyers of Gods heritage, that was their ſin; and now what muſt be their puniſhment? <hi>Your mother ſhall be ſore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, ſhe that bare you ſhall be aſhamed; behold the hindermoſt of the Nations ſhall be a wilderneſs, a dry land and a deſert; becauſe of the wrath of the Lord it ſhall not be inhabited, but it ſhall be wholly deſolate, every one that goeth by</hi> Babylon <hi>ſhall be aſtoniſhed, and hiſs at all her plagues.</hi> So in <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.34, 35. The Church complains there, that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> King of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon had devoured her, and cruſhed her, and made her an empty veſſel, and had ſwallowed her up like a Dragon, and filled his belly with her delicates and caſt her out. What then is the Churches dreadful imprecation hereupon? but that which was menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned before, <hi>The violence done to me and to my fleſh be upon</hi> Babylon, <hi>ſhall the inhabitants of</hi> Sion <hi>ſay, and my blood upon the inhabitants of</hi> Chaldea <hi>ſhall</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem <hi>ſay. Therefore thus ſaith the Lord, Behold I will plead thy cauſe, and take vengeance for thee, &amp;c. And</hi> Babylon <hi>ſhall become heaps, a dwelling place for Dragons, an aſtoniſhment, a hiſſing without an
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:66159:9"/>
inhabitant.</hi> And in the 33. <hi>Verſe, The Daughter of</hi> Babylon <hi>is like a threſhing floor, it is time to threſh her, yet a little while and the time of her harveſt ſhall come.</hi> So <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4. God calls his people there to come out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and wherefore? <hi>that ye be not partakers of her ſins</hi> (ſaith the voice from Heaven) <hi>and that ye receive not of her Plagues.</hi> So in the 8th. <hi>Verſe, Therefore ſhall her Plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine, and ſhe ſhall be utterly burnt with Fire, for ſtrong is the Lord who judgeth her.</hi> And what was <hi>Babylons</hi> great ſin? <hi>They have ſhed the blood of Saints and Prophets, and thou haſt given them blood to drink, for they are worthy,</hi> ſaid the Angel of the waters. <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.6. So <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.6. <hi>And I ſaw</hi> (ſaid <hi>John</hi> in a Viſion) <hi>the woman drunken with the blood of the Saints, and with the blood of the Martyrs of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus: And in her was found the blood of Prophets, and of Saints, and of all that were ſlain upon the earth,</hi> Rev. 18.24. And what follows? <hi>Allelujah, ſalvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God, for true and righteous are his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for he hath judged the great Whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his ſervants at her hand</hi> And again they ſaid, <hi>Allelujah, and her ſmoke roſe up for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the ſpeedy execution of which righteous judgements of God, upon this inſatiable and blood-thirſty Whore, it is, that the ſouls under the Altar, that have been ſlain for the Word of God, and for the Teſtimony which they held, are ſaid to cry with a loud voice, ſaying, How long Lord,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:66159:9"/>
holy and true, doſt not thou judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the Earth? To which anſwer is made, That they ſhould reſt yet for a little ſeaſon, until their Fellow-Servants alſo, and their brethren that ſhould be killed as they were, ſhould be fulfilled, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.9, 10, 11. That is, ſlain by Antichriſt and his Miniſters, who having Apoſtatized from the faith, ſhould ariſe in the Church of Chriſt ſoon after this, and by their ſpiritual pride and tyranny, oppreſs the Church, and perſecute and kill the Lords faithful Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, in like manner as the Gentiles the Jews, and other falſe Chriſtians had formerly done, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.7. <hi>and</hi> 12.15, 17. Yet this is very obſervable, as that which may miniſter matter of ſtrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation to the Saints ſuffering under Antichriſts bloody perſecutions, that there is the determinate time of Gods appointed Judgments, and that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever for a while the Lord defers his puniſhments, yet he certainly hears the Prayers of his faithful ſervants, and at laſt will be fully avenged on their Adverſaries. And though Antichriſts rage and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny is very great, yet it is limited according to the purpoſe and decree of God, who hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined the number of Martyrs, which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber being once accompliſhed, not one drop of blood ſhall be more ſpilt by that man of ſin, that Son of perdition; who (Satan like) worketh with all his power, compelling men by Fines, confiſcation of Goods, Impriſonments, Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the like, to ſubmit unto his ways and laws, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.3, 9. and that under fair and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious pretences too, for the ſuppreſſing of Errors
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:66159:10"/>
and Hereſies, for the beating down of ſin, for the working of men to conformity and uniformity, and the bringing of them into obedience unto the Church; which to do, if the Eccleſiaſtical power is not ſufficient, the Magiſterial power muſt be made uſe of. But it is very evident, that the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian religion, conſiſting for the moſt part in Will-worſhip, and in humane traditions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, could never have ſubſiſted to this day, had it not been ſupported by an Arm of fleſh; when as our Lord Jeſus with his Apoſtles and Diſciples, never ſought to the Civil Magiſtrate, or Powers of the World upon that accompt, nor is the Kingdom of Chriſt to be erected and eſtabliſhed in this way of humane force and power. The weapons of our warfare (ſaith the Apoſtle) are not carnal, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. It is the powers of the world that ſhall deſtroy the holy people, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.24. It is the Little Horn, the Romiſh Antichriſt, that ſhall make War with the Saints, and prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, until the Ancient of days come, and that judgment be given to the Saints of the moſt high, and that the time come that the Saints ſhall poſſeſs the Kingdom, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.21.22. It is he, <hi>that ſhall ſpeak great words againſt the moſt high, and ſhall wear out the Saints of the moſt high, &amp;c. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntil the Judgment ſhall ſit, and then they ſhall take away his dominion, to conſume and to deſtroy it unto the end, Dan.</hi> 7.25, 26. <hi>And in one day ſhall</hi> Babylons <hi>Plagues come, death, and mourning, and famine, and ſhe ſhall be utterly burnt with fire, for ſtrong is the Lord God who judgeth her,</hi> Rev. 18.8. The ſeverity of the Lord againſt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:66159:10"/>
this ſin of bloodſhed and cruelty, that is exerciſed on the Saints of God, is further ſet forth in that of the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> Chap. 1. Verſ. 11. (Thus ſaith the Lord) for three tranſgreſſions of <hi>Edom,</hi> and for four I will not turn away the puniſhment thereof; and why? Becauſe he did purſue his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Sword, and did caſt off all pity, and his anger did tear perpetually, and kept his wrath for ever. For this alſo hath the Lord a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie with the Land; becauſe, by killing and ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they break out, and blood toucheth blood. Therefore ſhall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein ſhall languiſh, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 4.1, 2, 3. So in the <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.5, 6. They break in pieces thy people, O Lord, and afflict thine heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, they ſlay the widow, and the ſtranger, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the fatherleſs; yet they ſay, the Lord ſhall not ſee. And what then? O Lord God, to whom ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance belongeth, ſhew thy ſelf: Lift up thy ſelf thou Judge of the earth, render a reward to the proud. So highly provoking is it unto the Lord, for any to have a hand in the deſtroying of Gods heritage; As the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith, When the Lord ſhall make inquiſition for blood, he will remember them, and not forget the cry of the humble, or of the afflicted.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The fourth peſtilential and highly provoking ſin, is the ſin of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> which is the worſhipping of falſe Gods, or the true God in a falſe manner. This is that ſin, that hath greatly incenſed the Lord to ſend this ſore Judgement of the Plague or Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and the Sword among a people, <hi>Judg.</hi> 5.8. It is ſaid, they choſe new gods, then was war in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:66159:11"/>
the gates. When <hi>Iſrael</hi> forſook the Lord, and his true worſhip, and fell to the worſhipping of the Idol-Gods of the Heathen, then the Lord ever and anon puniſhed them with war. And as the Sword, ſo the Peſtilence brake in among them for this very ſin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.28, 29. They joyned themſelves alſo to <hi>Baal-Peor,</hi> and eat the ſacrifices of the dead; Thus they provoked him to anger with their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, and the Plague brake in upon them. See <hi>Num.</hi> 25.2. to which this in the <hi>Pſalmes</hi> doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre. It is ſaid, they called the people to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of their Gods, and the people did eat and bowed down to their gods. And <hi>Iſrael</hi> joyned himſelf to <hi>Baal-peor,</hi> and the anger of the Lord was kindled againſt <hi>Iſrael;</hi> ſo that there died in the Plague, no leſs then four and twenty thouſand, and many more had been deſtroyed had not <hi>Phine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>has</hi> ſtood up and executed judgement, and turned away the wrath of the Lord, and ſo the Plague was ſtayed, as in the 30. <hi>verſe</hi> of that 106. <hi>Pſalm</hi> comp. with <hi>Num.</hi> 25.11. <hi>Baal-peor</hi> was the Idol-god of the <hi>Moabites,</hi> and the Daughters of the <hi>Moabites</hi> they called or invited the people to the ſacrifices or offerings of their gods; they allured the people by fleſhly baites to defile their bodies and ſouls with whoredom and idolatry, and the people they participated or communicated with them in their idolatry, which ſin God in a ſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner had forewarned them of, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.12, 13, 14, 15, 16.</p>
            <p>Take heed to thy ſelf, leſt thou make a Covenant with the Inhabitants of the Land, whither thou goeſt, leſt it be for a ſnare in the midſt of thee.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:66159:11"/>
But ye ſhall deſtroy their Altars, break their Images, and cut down their Groves. For thou ſhalt worſhip no other God, for the Lord whoſe name is Jealous, is a jealous God. Leſt thou make a Covenant with the Inhabitants of the Land, and they go a whoring after their gods, and do ſacrifice to their gods, and one call thee, and thou eat of his ſacrifice, and thou take of their Daughters unto thy Sons, and their Daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy Sons go a whoring after their gods. And hence it was, that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> dehorted the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> leſt they ſhould be guilty of the like ſin, and ſo incurre the like puniſhment, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.8. Neither let us commit fornication, as ſome of them committed (meaning ſpiritual as well as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral uncleanneſs) and fell in one day three and twenty thouſand, though there was four and twenty thouſand fell in all, but three and twenty thouſand of them fell or periſhed in one day.</p>
            <p>So when <hi>Moſes</hi> was in the Mount with God, and the People had made them a Molden Calf, and gave it Divine Adoration, ſaying, Theſe be thy gods O <hi>Iſrael</hi> which brought thee up out of the land of <hi>Egypt;</hi> How did the wrath of the Lord begin to wax hot againſt them for to conſume them, had not <hi>Moſes</hi> (his choſen) ſtood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, leſt he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them; yet, ſaith the Lord, <hi>Nevertheleſs, in the day when I viſit, I will viſit their ſin upon them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Lord plagued the people, becauſe they made the Calf which <hi>Aaron</hi> made. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Becauſe they have forſaken me, ſaith the Lord, and have eſtranged this place, and have burnt incenſe in it unto other gods, whom neither they nor their fathers have known, nor the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> and have filled this place with the blood of <hi>Innocents;</hi> they have built alſo the high places of <hi>Baal</hi> to burn their Sons with fire for burnt offerings unto <hi>Baal,</hi> which I commanded not, nor ſpake it, neither came it into my mind: Therefore, behold, the days come ſaith the Lord, that I will cauſe them to fall by the Sword before their enemies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and their Carkaſes will I give to be meat for the fowles of the heaven, and for the beaſts of the earth; and I will make this City deſolate and an hiſſing: every one that paſſeth thereby ſhall be aſtoniſhed and hiſs, becauſe of all the <hi>Plagues</hi> thereof. So <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.25, 26, 27. Wherefore (thus ſaith the Lord) ye eat with the blood and lift up your eyes towards your Idols, and ſhed blood, and ſhall ye poſſeſs the land? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus ſaith the Lord God. <hi>As I live, ſurely, they that are in the waſtes ſhall fall by the Sword,</hi> &amp;c. and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:66159:12"/>
they that be in the Forts, and in the Caves ſhall dye of the <hi>Peſtilence.</hi> For I will lay the Land moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate, and the pomp of her ſtrength ſhall ceaſe. Hence it is ſaid, that in <hi>Horeh</hi> they provoked the Lord to wrath, ſo that the Lord was angry with them to have deſtroyed them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 9.8. And <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.16, to 21. They provoked him to jealouſie with ſtrange gods, with abominations provoked they him to anger. They ſacrificed to Devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom their Fathers fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not. Of the Rock that begat them they were unmindful, and had forgotten God that formed them. What then? And when the Lord ſaw it, he abhorred them, becauſe of the provoking of his Sons, and of his Daughters. And he ſaid, I will hide my face from them, I will ſee what their end ſhall be.</p>
            <p>For this ſin of <hi>Idolatry</hi> it was that the Lord brought evil upon the houſe of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> ſmiting all his houſe, in ſo much that he left not to him any that breathed, but took them away, as a man taketh away dung, till it be all gone; for ſaith the Text, He made him other gods, and molten Images, to provoke the Lord to anger, and did caſt the Lord behind his back. See 1 <hi>King.</hi> 14.9. comp. with <hi>Chap.</hi> 15.29. and 30. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Add to this, that in the 44. of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the 7. and 8. <hi>Verſ.</hi> Thus ſaith the Lord, the God of Hoſts, the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore commit ye this great evil againſt your ſouls, to cut off from you man and woman, child and ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out of <hi>Judah,</hi> to leave you none to remain; In that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:66159:13"/>
of your hands, burning incenſe unto other gods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that ye might cut your ſelves off, and that ye might be a curſe and reproach among all the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the earth. So highly provoking is this ſin of Idolatry unto God, as you many ſee further <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.4, 5. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.14, 15. and 32.21. which I ſay (that we may not be miſtaken concerning it) doth conſiſt, not only in the worſhiping of Idols and falſe gods, but of the true God in a falſe manner.</p>
            <p>It may be, thou wilt not be ſo groſs, to fall down and give divine Adoration to an Image, yet if thou doſt worſhip God before and by an Image, thou art an Idolater. The Image which the <hi>Jews</hi> made of the true God, is condemned of God himſelf <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.8. and they that made it were puniſhed as Idolaters 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5, 7. It <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

               </gap> a dotage in Popery, to diſtinguiſh between Idol and Image, and to make the Picture of a falſe god onely to be an Idol; not conſidering, that the making of an Image, or the likeneſs of God, or of any Creature in Heaven or Earth for a religions end, to give it divine adoration and worſhip, or to worſhip God by it, is Idolatry, forbidden by the Scriptures, even by the Lord himſelf, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.8, 9. <hi>Thou ſhalt not make thee any graven Image, or any likeneſs of any thing,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thou ſhalt not bow down thy ſelf unto them, nor ſerve them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2ly. <hi>Idolatry</hi> may be ſaid to be <hi>all humane inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and traditions of men, thruſt into the divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ſervice of God,</hi> Deut. 12.32. Whatſoever I command you, ſaith the Lord, that obſerve and do, thou ſhalt not add thereto, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So ſaid our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>In vain they do worſhip me, teaching
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:66159:13"/>
for Doctrines the Commandments of men.</hi> And you tranſgreſs (or reject; fruſtrate and make void) the commandments of God by your traditions, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.3, 9. <hi>Mark.</hi> 7.9. Therefore all traditions and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions contrary to the Word of God, are to be avoided and abhorred by all who will be found worſhipping of God in ſpirit and in truth, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own inſtitution and preſcription.</p>
            <p n="3">3ly. The ſetting the heart inordinately upon any creature, by fearing, loving, and truſting in it more then in God, and above God, is Idolatry in Gods account. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.19. The Apoſtle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of ſome, whoſe God was there belly; and the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſpeaks of ſetting up of Idols in the heart. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.2, 4.</p>
            <p n="4">4ly. The Immoderate love unto, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſtful care for the things of this life, falls under this denomination of Idolatry. Hence it is that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That no unclean perſon, or covetous man who is an Idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Chriſt and of God, Eph.</hi> 5.5. the one makes his luſt, the other his mony his God. And the Apoſtle in <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. among other the ſins and luſts of the fleſh, calls Covetouſneſs Idolatry; For which things ſake (ſaith he) the wrath of God cometh on the children of diſobedience. All theſe kinds of Idolatries by the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> are expreſt I conceive, under the name and title of abominable Idolatries, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.3. Hence it is, I ſuppoſe, that <hi>John</hi> in the concluſion of his Epiſtle hath this exhortation to the beleivers of his time, <hi>Little children keep your ſelves from Idols.</hi> Now all Idols being vanities, and the work of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, which in the time of their viſitation ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:66159:14"/>
               <hi>Jer</hi> 10.15. Then it muſt needs follow, That they that obſerve lying vanities, forſake their own mercy, <hi>Jon.</hi> 2.8. And this is the fourth Peſtilential ſin, ſo highly provoking the Lord:</p>
            <p n="5">5. The fifth peſtilential deſtroying ſin, is the ſin of <hi>Covetouſneſs,</hi> conſiſting in a greedy inordinate deſire after gain, unto which evill whoſoever is ſubject is the ſervant and ſlave of all other ſins. So inſatiable and unſatisfied he is, that like the man that hath the Dropſie, the more he drinketh, the more he thirſteth. This ſin of Covetouſneſs is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Idolatry, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.5. Becauſe the covetous perſon not only prefers his treaſure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, but doth place the happineſs and felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his life in his ſubſtance; like the fool in the Goſpel, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.15, 16. And what ſin is there that is more provoking unto the Lord, or that pulls down more the wrath of God upon a Nation or Kingdom, as I inſtanced before, then the ſin of Idolatry? <hi>For which things ſake the wrath of God cometh on the children of diſobedience, Col.</hi> 3.6. So abhorring a ſin it is unto the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.3. The wicked bleſſeth the Covetous, whom the Lord abhorreth. And therefore I finde it rankt with thoſe other aforementioned ſo highly provoking ſins of <hi>Bloodſhed, Oppreſſion</hi> and <hi>Perſecution,</hi> Jer. 22.17. But thine eyes and thine heart are not but for thy covetouſneſs, and for to ſhed innocent blood, and for oppreſſion, and for violence to do it. And what before? Wo unto him, that build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his houſe by unrighteouſneſs, and his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers by wrong: Shalt thou reign becauſe thou clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:66159:14"/>
thy ſelf in cedar? Did not thy father eat and drink, and do judgement and juſtice, and then it was well with him? <hi>&amp;c. Jer.</hi> 22.13, 15. The like woe or denunciation of judgement againſt this vile provoking ſin, you have in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.8, 9. Woe unto them that joyn houſe to houſe, that lay field to field, till there be no place; that is, for the poor to dwell, that they may be placed alone in the midſt of the earth. And mark what follows, <hi>In mine ears ſaid the Lord of Hoſts, of a truth many houſes ſhall be deſolate, even great and fair without inhabitants.</hi> O that our great Builders and Incloſers of our times, would ſeriouſly lay this Scripture to heart. How many houſes now hath God made deſolate in City and Suburbs? how many great and fair dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings now ſtand empty without an inhabitant? You have the like woe denounced in <hi>Micha.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. <hi>Wo to them that deviſe iniquity, and work evil upon their beds, &amp;c. and they covet fields, and take them by violence, and houſes and take them away, ſo they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs a man and his houſe, even a man and his heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;</hi> And what follows hereupon? <hi>Therefore thus ſaith the Lord, Behold againſt this Family do I deviſe an evil, from which ye ſhall not remove your necks, neither ſhall ye go haughtily, for this time is evil.</hi> Mark, I pray you, its ſaid they covet fields, and houſes, and take them by violence; If they do but fancy or get a mind to ſuch and ſuch a piece of Land, to ſuch a Houſe, or ſuch like poſſeſſions, they will have it, and force it away from the owners thereof; As <hi>Ahab</hi> in the caſe of <hi>Naboths</hi> Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21. And thus they oppreſs, or practiſe violence upon a man and his houſe, even a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:66159:15"/>
man and his heritage, or his inheritance, that is, they make him poor and ſad, diſpoſſeſſing and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaving the Proprietor thereof, which God would in no wiſe allow to be taken away, or alienated from the heir. <hi>Therefore, ſaith the Lord, Behold I deviſe an evil againſt this Family, or againſt this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration:</hi> Even as they wickedly deviſe, contrive and practiſe the evil of ſin, ſo do I now deviſe the evil of puniſhment, that ſhall be executed upon them; from which ye ſhall not remove your necks; the yoke of bondage which ye ſhall be made to undergo, ſhall be ſo cloſe and ſtrong upon you. And from whence proceeds all theſe evil incroachments, theſe violent oppreſſions and practiſes, but from this evil and bitter root of covetouſneſs? Againſt which the Prophet <hi>Habak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kuk</hi> comes forth with the like woe, and denunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of judgment; <hi>Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetouſneſs to his houſe, that he may ſet his neſt on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil.</hi> And mark what follows? <hi>Thou haſt conſulted ſhame to thy houſe, by cutting off many people, and haſt ſinned againſt thy ſoul; For the ſtone ſhall cry out of the Wall, and the beam out of the Timber ſhall anſwer it. Woe to him that buildeth a Town with blood, and eſtabliſheth a City by iniquity. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, is it not of the Lord of Hoſts, that the people ſhall labour in the very fire, and the people ſhall weary themſelves for very vanity,</hi> Hab. 2.9, 10, 11, 12, 13. <hi>Woe to him that coveteth an evil cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, that he may ſet his neſt on high,</hi> that is, that ſeeks and practices by all manner of baſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, and unwarrantable ways, to inrich him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:66159:15"/>
his wife, children, and poſterity, that he and his family may riſe and become great and famous in the world, and live ſecure and ſafe. A ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude taken from the Eagle and ſuch Birds, as love to build their Neſts in high places. <hi>Obad.</hi> 4. Well, but conſider a little what thou art doing all this while in contriving to be ſo great; Thou haſt but conſulted ſhame to thy houſe, ſaith the Lord, as if he had ſaid, Thou haſt (ſetting all honour and honeſty aſide) raked much riches together, and raiſed great and ſtately Palaces and Places, and filled and adorned the ſame with all manner of rich and ſumptuous furniture, yet all this ſpeaks but thy own ſhame and infamy, becauſe thou haſt accumulated, and heaped all this together, by thy covetous and unworthy practiſes. And thou haſt ſinned againſt thy own ſoul in all that thou haſt done. <hi>And therefore the ſtone out of the Wall ſhall cry;</hi> The very Stones wherewith thy Palaces are built, ſhall teſtifie againſt thee, namely, that thou haſt built them unrighteouſly, by wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and injuring of others, which call aloud to God for vengeance againſt thee. <hi>And therefore woe to him that buildeth a City with blood,</hi> or <hi>bloods,</hi> as it is in the Original; that is, with murder, or with the goods of him or them that are ſlain or murdered, or with the ſweat and blood of the people. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> calls it the bloody City; <hi>Woe to the bloody City, I will even make the pile for fire great,</hi> Ezek. 24.9. So the Prophet <hi>Nahum; Woe to the bloody City, or City of bloods, it is full of lies and robberies, the prey departeth not. And therefore, Behold, it is not of the Lord, that the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:66159:16"/>
people ſhall labour in the very fire, and weary them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for vanity?</hi> It is of the Lord ſurely, it comes to paſs by the ſecret counſel of God, that theſe Houſes and Cities which they build, ſhall either come to be conſumed by fire; And what dreadful fires hath hapned amongſt us of late days? or elſe the people ſhall weary them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in vain, for vanity and to no purpoſe; ſeeing it comes ſo ſoon to be deſtroyed and ruina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, what they build.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore ſaith the Lord, Behold I have ſmitten my hand at thy diſhoneſt gain which thou haſt made, and at thy blood which hath been in the midſt of thee,</hi> Ezek. 22.13. intimating an abhorring of their wickedneſs, and a purpoſe to proceed againſt them in fury, as is expounded in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 21.17. <hi>I will ſmite my hands together, and I will cauſe my fury to reſt; I the Lord have ſaid it.</hi> All hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth the Lords great diſpleaſure againſt this ſore evil, which is more evidently manifeſted, by conſulting ſome few Verſes more in that 22. of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> beginning at the 24th. <hi>Verſe. Son of man, ſay unto her, Thou art the land that is not cleanſed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.</hi> As if the Lord had ſaid, Thou art the Land that is not amended or reformed by my Judgements, and puniſhments, that hath not had her ſhowers of rain to cleanſe thee; my judgements will not cleanſe thee. As a great ſhowre of rain (you know) is wont to cleanſe and waſh away the filth and dirt of the ſtreets; Thy filthineſs remains ſtill unwaſhed away: But how comes this to paſs? <hi>There is a conſpiracy of her Prophets in the midſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:66159:16"/>
like a roaring Lyon ravening the prey: they have devoured ſouls:</hi> And what elſe? <hi>They have taken the Treaſure and precious things: they have made her many Widows in the midſt thereof.</hi> They did devour the godly mens eſtates, and bereaved the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of their Husbands, by their falſe accuſations, and evil practiſes, cauſing them to be put to death.</p>
            <p>This was that devouring of Widows houſes, which our bleſſed Saviour ſo ſharply reproved, the <hi>Scribes,</hi> and <hi>Phariſes,</hi> and Hypocrites of thoſe days, and all under a pretence of making long Prayers. <hi>Therefore,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ye ſhall receive the greater damnation,</hi> Mat. 23.14. Much like to what the Prophet <hi>Micha</hi> ſpake of in his day, <hi>Micha</hi> 3.10, 11, 12. <hi>They build up</hi> Zion <hi>with blood, and</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>with iniquity.</hi> The heads thereof judge for reward, and the Prieſts thereof teach for hire, and the Prophets thereof divine for money; Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that, <hi>Yet will they lean upon the Lord, and ſay, is not the Lord among us? none evil can come upon us. The Prieſts taught for hire,</hi> that is, out of a covetous diſpoſition, they ſuffered themſelves to be drawn for money to Teach and Preach accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to mens Pallates, like to thoſe which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake to <hi>Titus</hi> of, <hi>who ſubverted whole houſes, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucres ſake,</hi> Tit. 1.11. Whereas they ſhould have been content with Gods allowance, and held forth the pure Word of God without regard to men. <hi>In whoſe mouths the Law of truth ſhould be, and in whoſe lips iniquity ſhould not be found,</hi> Mal. 2.6. Thus for the Prieſts; Then for the Prophets, they
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:66159:17"/>
did divine for money, meaning the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. The Lord implying here, that both in the Civil and Eccleſiaſtical State among his people all was corrupted, and to be bought and ſold for money; According to what the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> complained in his time, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.23. <hi>Thy Princes are rebellious and companions of Thieves; every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards, they Judge not the Fatherleſs, neither doth the cauſe of the Widow come unto them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or as he proceeds further in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.26, 27. <hi>Her Prieſts have violated my law, and have prophaned my holy things; they have put no difference between the holy and prophane, nor between the unclean and the clean. Her Princes in the midſt thereof are like roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wolves, ravening the prey, to ſhed blood and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy ſouls, and to get diſhoneſt gain.</hi> And yet ſays the Prophet <hi>Micah, They did lean upon the Lord.</hi> How lean upon the Lord? not with a holy truſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence (which is ever accompanied with godlineſs) but in hypocriſie, out of an impudent arrogancy, and a vain, bold and carnal preſumption; as if God was engaged to protect them, let them live and do what they pleaſed; Like thoſe that the Prophet <hi>Iſay</hi> ſpeaks of, That ſwore by the name of the Lord, and made mention of the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but not in truth, nor in righteouſneſs; And yet they called them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the holy City, and ſtaied themſelves upon the God of <hi>Iſrael, Iſa.</hi> 48.1, 2. Or like unto them in the Prophet <hi>Jeremies</hi> time, that cried <hi>The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord,</hi> and yet in the mean time they oppreſſed the ſtranger, the fatherleſs, and the widow, and ſhed innocent blood,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:66159:17"/>
and did ſteal, and murder and commit adultery, and ſwore falſely, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.4, 6, 9. But how intollerable this was with God, the ſequel makes it evident; <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall Sion for your ſakes be ploughed as a field, and Jeruſalem ſhall become heaps,</hi> that is, ſhall be utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroyed and laid waſte; So little care and regard had God of <hi>Sion</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and of his holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple it ſelf, being thus polluted and defiled. And therefore ſaith the Lord (in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 3, 2. <hi>ult.) have I poured out mine indignation upon them, I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed them with the fire of my wrath: Their own way have I recompenſed upon their heads, ſaith the Lord.</hi> So again, for this doth the Lord threaten, That their houſes ſhall be turned unto others, with their fields and wives together. And he will ſtretch out his hand upon the inhabitants of the land. For (ſaith he) from the leaſt of them even unto the greateſt of them, every one is given to Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and from the Prophet even unto the Prieſt, every one dealeth falſly, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.12, 13. Which ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricious or covetous diſpoſition was ſo predominant in them in the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah's</hi> time, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.10, 11.

of his Fathers be remembred with the Lord, and let not the ſin of his Mother be blotted out, and let the Lord cut off the memory of them from the earth. And mark what follows. As he loved curſing, ſo let it come unto him; as he delighted not in bleſſing, ſo let it be far from him. As he cloathed himſelf with curſing like as with a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo let it come into his bowels like water, and like oyle into his bones. Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually. It is true the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> doth apply ſomething of this to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> who betrayed our Lord Chriſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.20. But it cannot exclude all other the curſed enemies of Chriſt, who love curſing, and cloath themſelves with it as with a garment. So <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.9, 10. <hi>Mine heart within me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is broken, becauſe of the Prophete, all my bones ſhake,</hi> &amp;c. becauſe of the Lord, and becauſe of the words of his holineſs. For the Land is full of Adulterers, for becauſe of <hi>Swearing the Land mourneth.</hi> To this agreeth that of the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> Chapter 4.1, 2, 3. verſes. Where it is ſaid, That the Lord hath a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie with the Inhabitants of the Land, becauſe there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the Land. By ſwearing and lying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they break out and blood toucheth blood: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall the Land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein ſhall languiſh. The dreadfulneſs of this ſin is further ſet forth by <hi>Zacharies</hi> flying roll, <hi>Zach.</hi> 5.3, 4. This is the Curſe that goeth forth, over the face of the whole earth, for every one that ſtealeth ſhall be cut off, and every one that ſweareth ſhall be cut off, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I will bring it forth,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:66159:19"/>
ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, and it ſhall enter into the houſe of the Theif, and into the houſe of him that ſweareth falſely by my name; and it ſhall remain in the midſt of his houſe, and ſhall conſume it with the Timber thereof, and the Stones thereof. And in the 3. of <hi>Malachy</hi> and the 5. I will come near to you to Judgement, and I will be a ſwift witneſs againſt the <hi>Sorcerers,</hi> and againſt the <hi>Adulterers,</hi> and againſt <hi>Falſe-ſwearers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O that theſe things were ſeriouſly laid to heart by the prophane Curſers, and Swearers, and Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwearers, and the Damme-creatures of our times. O that they would conſider, how their curſed hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh hideous, new-invented, unheard of, Diabolical oaths, do now make the Land mourn, and thoſe that dwell therein to languiſh! and how near the Lord is come unto them in the terribleneſs of his judgment! Is it not very evident that the Lord for theſe things hath a controverſie with the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Land?</p>
            <p n="7">7. The ſeventh Peſtilential deſtroying ſin, is the ſin of <hi>Adultery, Fornication,</hi> and ſuch like cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral uncleanneſs. See this in that 25. of <hi>Num.</hi> 1, 6, 7, 8. <hi>verſes.</hi> When <hi>Iſrael</hi> abode in <hi>Shittim,</hi> it is ſaid the people began to commit Whoredome with the daughters of <hi>Moab.</hi> And <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cosbi</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken in the very act of uncleanneſs, <hi>Phinehas</hi> the Son of <hi>Eleazar,</hi> the Son of <hi>Aaron</hi> the Prieſt, when he ſaw it, he roſe up from amongſt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and took a Javelin in his hand, and he went after the man of <hi>Iſrael</hi> into the Tent, and thruſt both of them through, the man of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the woman through her belly: So the Plague
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:66159:19"/>
was ſtayed thereupon from the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet thoſe that died in the Plague, as was mentioned before, was no leſs then Twenty and four Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand. So in the 12. of <hi>Gen.</hi> 14, 15, 17. When <hi>Abraham</hi> came into <hi>Egypt</hi> with <hi>Sarai</hi> his wife, a fair woman to look upon, and ſhe was no ſooner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held by the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and the Princes of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> but they commended her before <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> and ſaith the Text, the woman was taken into <hi>Pharaohs</hi> houſe, that is, ſhe was taken away from <hi>Abraham,</hi> into the Royal Seraglio or Palace, to be fitted and prepared there, according to the Cuſtome of thoſe Countries, that the King might take her to Wife, as <hi>Heſt.</hi> 2.9. In the mean time God provided for <hi>Abrahams</hi> entertainment, and his Wives chaſtity together; for <hi>Pharaoh</hi> entreated <hi>Abram</hi> well for her ſake. And in the 17. <hi>verſe</hi> is is ſaid, <hi>The Lord plagued</hi> Pharaoh <hi>and his Houſe with great Plagues, becauſe of</hi> Sarai, Abrams <hi>wife.</hi> What kind of plagues thoſe were is uncertain, but doubtleſs they ſerved as well to hinder and obſtruct the abuſing of <hi>Sarai</hi>'s body, as to puniſh the King, and his Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, and Courtiers treſpaſs. This great delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance <hi>David</hi> celebrateth in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.14. <hi>When they went from one Nation to another, from one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to another People. He ſuffered no man to do them wrong, yea, he reproved Kings for their ſakes,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Touch not mine anointed, and do my Prophets no harm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is obſervable, that if the Lord was ſo ſevere to puniſh this filthy ſin of Adultery, or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, when it was but deſignedly or intentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally committed (and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> knew not that <hi>Sarai</hi> was <hi>Abrams</hi> wife) with what ſeverity may we think
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:66159:20"/>
will he proceed againſt ſuch, who deliberately, knowingly, delightfully and impudently live in the perpetration and commiſſion of it? and when did this ſin of Whoredom, Adultery and Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ever walk upon down ſo brazen-faced, with ſuch an imperious woriſh forehead, as in the men and women of our generation? ſo unſatiable they are in their filthineſs and uncleanneſs. Upon which account may not the Lord ſay to this City of <hi>London,</hi> yea to the Land and Nation in general, as he did to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi>'s time? <hi>How ſhall I pardon thee for this? thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren have forſaken me, and ſworn by them that are no gods: When I had fed them to the full, they then committed Adultery, and aſſembled themſelves by troops in the harlots houſes. They were as fed horſes in the morning, every one neighed after his neighbours wife;</hi> Through luſtfulneſs, like wanton horſes: And mark what follows? <hi>Shall I not viſit for theſe things, ſaith the Lord? and ſhall not my ſoul be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged on ſuch a Nation as this? Go ye up upon her walls and deſtroy, but make not a full end; take away her battlements, for they are not the Lords, &amp;c.</hi> Jer. 5.7, 8, 9, 10. And may we not think the Lord may juſtly have a controverſie with the inhabitants of this Land, as he had with the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi>'s time; And wherefore? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land; But by ſwearing, and lying, and killing, and ſtealing, and <hi>committing Adultery</hi> they break out, and blood toucheth blood. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein ſhall languiſh, <hi>&amp;c. Hoſ.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3. So that good Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> Mine heart (ſaith he)
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:66159:20"/>
within me is broken, becauſe of the Prophets, all my bones ſhake, I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine hath overcome, becauſe of the Lord, and becauſe of the words of his holineſs. For the Land is full of <hi>Adulteries, Jer.</hi> 23.9, 10. And in <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.27. I have ſeen thine <hi>Adulteries,</hi> and thy neighings, the lewdneſs of thy Whoredoms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What then? <hi>Wo unto thee O Jeruſalem.</hi> This, though it may have reference to their ſin of Idolatry, as before, which may be called ſpiritual Adultery, yet it cannot exclude that which is corporeal, which God will ſeverely puniſh; <hi>For Whoremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Adulterers God will judge, as ſuch, who ſhall have no inheritance in the Kingdom of Chriſt and of God,</hi> Heb. 13.4. and <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.5. Thus we ſee how highly provoking this ſin of uncleaneſs is for the bringing down of National judgements, even this of the Peſtilence among a people.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The Eighth Sin that provokes the Lord to ſend the Peſtilence among a people, is the ſin of <hi>Infidelity, diſtruſt and murmuring againſt God,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the great and marvellous works which the Lord hath wrought for the ſalvation and deliverance of his people. See to this purpoſe the 13, and 14. chapters of <hi>Numbers;</hi> There were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain men, the heads of the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who by the commandment of the Lord was ſent to ſearch and ſpie out the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and being returned they made a rehearſal thereof to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and to all the congregation, and brought an evil report upon the land which they had ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſaying, The land through which we have gone to ſearch it, is a land that eateth up the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:66159:21"/>
thereof, and all the people that we ſaw in it are men of a great ſtature: And there we ſaw the giants, the ſons of <hi>Anak,</hi> which come of the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, and we were in our own ſight as Graſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and ſo were we in their ſight. This evil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port cauſed all the congregation to lift up their voyce and cry, and to murmure againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> ſaying, Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt, or would God we had died in this wilderneſs. And wherefore hath the Lord brought us into this land to fall by the ſword, that our wives and our children ſhould be a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt? and they ſaid one to another, <hi>Let us make a Captain, &amp; let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into Egypt.</hi> But <hi>Joſhua</hi> the ſon of <hi>Nun,</hi> and <hi>Caleb</hi> the ſon of <hi>Jephunneth,</hi> which were of them that ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the land, rent their cloaths, and they ſpake unto all the company of the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſaying, The land which we paſſed through to ſearch, it is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding good land, if the Lord delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it us, a land which floweth with milk and honey, <hi>Only rebell not ye againſt the Lord, neither fear ye the people of the land: for they are bread for us: Their defence is departed from them, &amp; the Lord is with us; fear them not:</hi> this ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incenſed the congregation, that they badeſtone them with ſtones. But ſee how highly provoking was this unto the Lord: <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>How long will this people provoke me, and how long will it be ere they beleive me, for all the ſigns that I have ſhewed among them?</hi> And mark what follows; <hi>I will ſmite them with the Peſtilence and diſ-inherit them,</hi> verſe 12. <hi>I the Lord have ſaid, I will ſurely do it unto all this evil congregation, that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:66159:21"/>
are gathered together againſt me; in this wilderneſs they ſhall be conſumed, and there they ſhall die.</hi> And further it is ſaid, That the men which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſent to ſearch the land, who returned and made all the congregation to <hi>murmure</hi> againſt him, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up a ſlander upon the land, even thoſe men that did bring up the evil report upon the land, died of the <hi>Plague</hi> before the Lord, <hi>verſ.</hi> 35, 36, 37, of the 14. of <hi>Numb.</hi> And the Lord renders the reaſon why their carkaſſes ſhould fall in the Wilderneſs, <hi>v.</hi> 22. <hi>Becauſe all thoſe men which have ſeen my glory</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and my miracles which I did in</hi> Egypt, <hi>and in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, &amp; have tempted me now theſe ten times, and have not hearkned to my voyce, ſurely, they ſhall not ſee the land, which I ſware unto their fathers, neither ſhall any of them that provoked me ſee it.</hi> So greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing it is unto the Lord, for a people who have ſeen the wonderful works of the Lord, and his miraculous preſervations, to cheriſh a murmuring, diſtruſting and unbeleiving ſpirit againſt the Lord; not beleiving his promiſes, nor relying on his mighty power, and outſtretched arm to defend them. And therefore ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>was the Lord wroth, and a fire was kindled againſt</hi> Jacob, <hi>and anger alſo came up againſt</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Becauſe they beleived not in God, and truſted not in his ſalvation,</hi> Pſ. 78.21, 22. So in <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.17, 18, 19. <hi>With whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had ſinned, whoſe carkaſſes fell in the wilderneſs? And to whom ſwore he that they ſhould not enter into his reſt, but to them that beleived not? So we ſee that they could not enter in becauſe of unbeleif.</hi> For this cauſe it was that the Lords wrath was kindled againſt them, ſo that he excluded them out of the good land, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:66159:22"/>
they beleived not in God, nor hearkned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his voyce, but murmured againſt him, after they had ſeen his glory, to wit his glorious works, and the miracles that he did in <hi>Egypt</hi> and in the wilderneſs. See <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.2, 3. comp. with <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9. from the 10th. to the 18th. verſe. O then that this might be ſeriouſly laid to heart, by all ſuch, who having ſeen the wonderful outgoings, and appearances of God in this latter age of the world, and had a deep ſhare in the glorious deliverances which God had wrought have yet through a heart of infidelity and diſtruſt departed from God, &amp; thereby brought up an evil report upon the good land, even the good and honourable ways of the Lord, ſhaking hands again with a carnal, corrupt intereſt, and longing after the fleſh-pots, the Onyons and Garlick of Egypt, have turned again to the weak and beggarly elements or rudiments of the world, whereunto they are, as in Egyptian bandage, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain captivated and enſlaved.</p>
            <p>For I intend not here by this ſpirit of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity and Unbeleif, ſuch carnal, unbeleiving and regenerate perſons, to whom, as the Apoſtle ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3, 4. the Goſpel is hid, and are loſt, and whoſe <hi>minds the God of this world hath blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt cannot ſhine into them;</hi> but ſuch rather, <hi>who with open face, having beheld as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord;</hi> even the glory of his grace in the Goſpel, and the glory of his great and wonderful works in the world, do yet through baſe fear, and diſtruſt of his power and promiſes, ſuffer their hearts to depart and turn aſide from the Lord. And this was the ſin of <hi>Aſa,</hi> who when the Lord had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:66159:22"/>
into his hand a huge hoſt of the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> and <hi>Lubims,</hi> becauſe they relied on him, did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards rely on the Kings of <hi>Syria,</hi> and not on the Lord his God; For which he received ſo ſharp a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke from the Lord, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.7, 8, 9.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The ninth Peſtilential ſin, is the ſin of <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content,</hi> accompanied alſo with a ſpirit of <hi>diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs</hi> and unbeleif; When a people will not be content with Gods allowance, but will loath his bleſſings and his proviſions, and fall a luſting after evil things to ſatisfie their inordinate deſires. This was <hi>Iſraels</hi> provoking ſin, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.4. The mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude that was among them fell a luſting, and they wept and ſaid, <hi>Who ſhall give us fleſh to eat? We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the fiſh which we did eat in</hi> Egypt <hi>freely, the Cucumbers, and the Melons, and the Leeks, and the Onyons, and the Garlick; but now our ſouls is dried away, there is nothing at all beſides this Manna before our eyes:</hi> Though it was the corn of heaven, and Angels food that they eat, and ſuch as did prefigure Chriſt himſelf, his word and grace, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.31, 32, 33. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.3. yet now they look upon it, and count it but as a deſpicable thing; and nothing no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> would ſatisfie them but fleſh, and this to ſatisfie their luſt. And therefore it is ſaid in the 78 Pſalm and the 18th. verſe. <hi>They tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their luſt; yea they ſpake againſt God and ſaid, Can God furniſh a table in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs? Behold, he ſmote the rock that the waters guſhed out, and the ſtreams overflowed; Can be give bread alſo? Can be provide fleſh for his people? Therefore the Lord heard this and was wroth: So a
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:66159:23"/>
fire was kindled againſt</hi> Jacob, <hi>and anger alſo came up againſt</hi> Iſrael, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Well, nothing would ſatisfie their luſts but fleſh, and fleſh they ſhall have with a witneſs, till it come out at their very noſtrils, and was loathſom unto them, ſo they did eat and were filled; for he gave them their own deſire: they were not eſtranged from their luſt; but while the fleſh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, <hi>The wrath of the Lord was kindled againſt the people, and the Lord ſmote the people with a very great plague:</hi> And the name of that place was call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Kibroch-hattanah</hi> (that is, the graves of luſt) becauſe, there they buried the people that luſted.</p>
            <p>Hence it was that the Apoſtle treating of the bountiful dealings of God with the children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> ſaid, <hi>That with many of them God was not well pleaſed; for they were overthrown in the wilderneſs. Now theſe things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>were our examples, to the intent we ſhould not luſt after evil things, as they alſo luſted,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.5, 6. This is a ſore evil, an inteſtine evil, a ſickneſs indeed, that gnaws and torments the very heart, called therefore the <hi>Plague of Diſcontent,</hi> which many of the people of God themſelves, as well as the men of the world are too too often infected with, when not content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves, I ſay, with the mercies and bleſſings which God affords us, we fall a luſting after evil things, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> hereafter fleſh, to ſatisfie their luſts, loathing the heavenly Manna which God gave them: And our deſires oftentimes are ſo inordinate after them, that like unto <hi>Rachel</hi> in the caſe of her barrenneſs (though otherwiſe bleſt with many comfortable enjoyments) we are cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:66159:23"/>
out, <hi>Give me children or elſe I die, Gen.</hi> 30.1. I cannot live, my life will be a burden unto me if I have not this or that; I muſt have it whatever it coſt me, though I part with half of my eſtate; nay, with <hi>Herod,</hi> it may be to the half of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, for his <hi>Herodias</hi> ſake, becauſe ſhe pleaſed him; and to ſatisfie this luſt, <hi>Off muſt go John Baptiſts head,</hi> Mark 6.22, 23, 24. Or like unto <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> who though he was ſo highly promoted in King <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> Court, <hi>Yet</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>all this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth me nothing, ſo long as I ſee</hi> Mordecai <hi>the Jew ſitting at the Kings gate,</hi> Heſt. 5.13. <hi>Mordecai</hi> could not bow the knee, nor do him that rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as his proud ambitious heart panted after, and this ſowres all other his great advancements and enjoyments, and now nothing will ſatisfie him leſs then his deſtruction, and the total deſtruction of all the Jews, <hi>Heſt.</hi> 3.9.</p>
            <p>So violent are perſons ſet upon the ſatisfying of their luſts oftentimes, though it be to their own hurt: This was the ſin of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> they could not content themſelves that God was their King, and that he ſhould reign over them, but they muſt have a King to reign over them, like unto other Nations; rejecting the Lord and his Government, who himſelf had ſaved them out of all their adverſities and tribulations, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.5, 6, 7. and chap. 10.19. And how great this wickedneſs of theirs was in the fight of the Lord, the ſignal te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of his diſpleaſure did evidently declare it, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.17. So is it not juſt with God when a people falls a loathing of the heavenly Manna of Gods Word (and where hath the Goſpel been more powerfully preached, and more obſtinately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:66159:24"/>
then in <hi>England?</hi>) that the Lord ſhould ſend a famine in the Land, if not a famine of bread and a thirſt for water, yet a famine of hearing the Words of the Lord, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.11. O that this was ſeriouſly laid to heart, and fruitfully applyed both by Profeſſors, as by the propbane perſons of this Nation. So dangerous and deſtructive a thing it is to cheriſh a carnal diſſatisfied and diſcontented ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit againſt the Lord.</p>
            <p n="10">10. A tenth Peſtilential and God-provoking Sin, is the ſin of <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Ambition,</hi> and a truſting in an Arme of fleſh, not relying on the mighty pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and faithfulneſs of God. This was <hi>Davids</hi> ſin in of numbring the people, which was followed with a ſore Prſtilence among them. See the ſecond of <hi>Samuel</hi> 24. <hi>Chap.</hi> comp. with 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.1. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan he provoked <hi>David</hi> to number the people, that he might know how many valiant men there were in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that could draw the ſword. And que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſs <hi>Davids</hi> heart was lifted up hereby, when <hi>Joab</hi> gave up the ſum of the number of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple unto him, there being in <hi>Iſrael</hi> eight hundred thouſand valiant men that drew the ſword, and the men of <hi>Judah</hi> were five hundred thouſand. And what ſhould move <hi>David</hi> to ſuch a thing but a proud ambitious deſire to know the ſtrength and number of his men of war, accompanied with a diſtruſtfulneſs of the mighty power of God, and his All-ſufficient arme, which had ſo often ſaved and delivered him out of the hands of <hi>Saul,</hi> and from the hand of all his enemies. As in the 18th. <hi>Pſal.</hi> wherein he praiſeth God for his mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold and marvellous deliverances. For this <hi>Davids</hi> heart ſmote him, acknowledging that he had ſinned
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:66159:24"/>
greatly in what he had done, and prayeth that the Lord would take away his iniquity, for he had done very fooliſhly. Yet the Lord would ſhew his juſtice, &amp; make all the world to ſee and know, that he will not indulge ſin, no not in his deareſt Servants, and moſt beloved Saints; but if they ſin they muſt expect to ſuffer and ſmart for it. As <hi>Amos</hi> 3.2. <hi>You only have I known of all the families of the earth, therefore I will puniſh you for all your iniquities.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he puts <hi>David</hi> upon his choiſe of three things, whether the Famine, the Sword, or Peſtilence he would make choiſe of, and this did put him into a great ſtreight, but he choſe rather to fall into the hands of God, then into the hands of men, for that the mercies of the Lord are great. So the Lord ſent a <hi>Peſtilence</hi> upon <hi>Iſrael,</hi> from the morning even to the time appointed, and there died of the people from <hi>Dan</hi> even to <hi>Beerſheba, Seventy thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men.</hi> And when the Angel ſtretched out his hand upon <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ready to deſtroy it, it is ſaid, the Lord repented him of the evil, and ſaid to the Angel that deſtroyed the people, <hi>It is enough, ſtay now thy hand.</hi> This alſo was <hi>Edoms</hi> ſin, <hi>Jer.</hi> 49.16, 17, 18. Thy terribleneſs hath deceived thee, &amp; the pride of thine heart, O thou that dwelleſt in the clefts of the rock: That holdeſt the height of the hill: though thou ſhouldſt make thy neſt as high as the Eagle, I will bring thee down from thence ſaith the Lord.

And mark what follows. <hi>Therefore ſhall the ſtrength of</hi> Pharaoh <hi>be your ſhame, and the truſt in the ſhadow of</hi> Egypt <hi>your confuſion.</hi> Which cauſed the Lord to take up that bitter complaint, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.12, 13. <hi>Be aſtoniſhed, O ye heavens at this, and be horribly afraid:</hi> Why? whats the matter? <hi>My peo- have committed two evils: They have forſaken me the Fountain of Living Water, and hewed them out Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterns, broken Ciſterns that can hold no water.</hi> All other things to relye upon beſides God, will prove but as broken Ciſterns.

            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:66159:25"/>Take we heed then of any preſumptuous relying on our own ſtrength, or of ſtrengthening our ſelves in the ſtrength of any creatures, whether Armies, or Parliaments, or Navies, or any ſinful confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies or Aſſociations of men whatſoever, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.9. <hi>Curſed is the man that truſteth in man, and maketh fleſh his arme; and whoſe heart departeth from the Lord,</hi> Jer. 17.5.

            <p n="11">11. The eleventh provoking Peſtilential deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sin, is the ſin of <hi>Apoſtacy, Back-ſliding,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volting</hi> from God, <hi>Jer,</hi> 2.18, 19. <hi>And now what haſt thou to do (ſaith the Lord) in the way of</hi> Egypt <hi>to drink the waters of</hi> Sihor? <hi>or what haſt thou to do in the way of</hi> Aſſyria, <hi>to drink the waters of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver?
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:66159:26"/>
Thine own wickedneſs ſhall correct thee, and thy back-ſliding ſhall reprove thee: Know therefore and ſee that it is an evil thing and bitter, that thou haſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken the Lord thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> So in the 36. verſe. <hi>Why gaddeſt thou about ſo much to change thy way? thou alſo ſhalt be aſhamed of</hi> Egypt. And now behold, how the Lord for this did threaten, that his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, even this of the <hi>Peſtilence</hi> ſhould overtake them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 42.13, 14, 15, 16, 17. <hi>We will not dwell in this land</hi> (ſay they) <hi>nor obey the voice of the Lord your God; No, but we will go into the land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>where we ſhall ſee no war, nor hear the ſound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread, and there will we dwell. And now therefore hear the Word of the Lord, ye remnant of</hi> Judah, <hi>thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, the God of</hi> Iſrael; <hi>If ye wholly ſet your faces to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> Egypt, <hi>and go to ſojourn there.</hi> What then? <hi>Then it ſhall come to paſs, that the Sword which ye feared ſhall overtake you there in the land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and the Famine whereof you were afraid ſhall follow cloſe after you there in</hi> Egypt, <hi>and there ye ſhall dye; ſo ſhall it be with all the men that ſet their faces to go into</hi> Egypt <hi>to ſojourn there, they ſhall dye by the Sword, by the Famine, and by the</hi> Peſtilence, <hi>and none of them ſhall remain or eſcape from the evil that I will bring upon them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſays further, that as his anger and fury had been poured forth upon the Inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> ſo ſhould his fury be poured forth upon them, when they ſhould enter into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and they ſhall be an execration, and an aſtoniſhment, and a curſe, and a reproach, and ſhould ſee the place (meaning the land of <hi>Judea</hi>) no more. So in the 19. <hi>verſe,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:66159:26"/>
O ye remnant of</hi> Judah, <hi>go ye not into</hi> Egypt; and now I have this day declared it unto you, but ye have not obeyed the voice of the Lord your God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now therefore know certainly that ye ſhall dye by the Sword, by the Famine, and by the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence, in the place whither ye deſire to go and to ſojourn. So in the 44. <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>Jer.</hi> 13. <hi>ver. For I will puniſh them that dwell in the land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>as I have puniſhed</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>by the Sword, by the Famine, and by the Peſtilence.</hi> To which I ſhall add that in the 14. of <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. and 12. <hi>verſ. Thus ſaith the Lord unto the people, Thus have they loved to wander, they have not refrained their feet: therefore the Lord doth not accept them, he will now remember their iniquity, and viſit their ſins. Then ſaid the Lord unto me; Pray not for this people for their good. When they faſt, I will not hear their cry, and when they offer burnt-offering, and an oblation, I will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept them: but I will conſume them by the Sword, and by the Famine, and by the Peſtilence.</hi> So dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and dangerous a thing it is, for a people brought out of <hi>Egyptian</hi> bondage and darkneſs, to long after the Fleſh-pots, the Leeks, and the Onions, and the Garlick of <hi>Egypt</hi> again. <hi>For if any man draw back (ſaith the Lord) my ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him,</hi> Heb. 10.38. <hi>And as for ſuch as turn aſide unto their crooked ways, the Lord ſhall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity, but peace ſhall be upon</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 125.5.</p>
            <p>O that this were well conſidered by all ſuch who have Apoſtatized and Revolted from the Lord and his ways, in this ſinful and back-ſliding generation. Who as the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> ſays, <hi>Are profound to make ſlaughter, though the Lord is a Rebuker of them
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:66159:27"/>
all,</hi> Hoſ. 5.2. Who once did appear to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Aſſertors of the Cauſe of righteouſneſs and truth; but now ſay a Confederacy, with all ſuch as ſay a Confederacy, <hi>Iſa</hi> 8.12. Who once did ſeem to eſcape the pollutions of the world, through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; but are now again intangled therein and overcome, turning with the Dog to his own vomit again, and with the Sow that was waſhed, to the wallowing in the mire. Let ſuch know, <hi>That their latter end will be worſe with them then the beginning,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.20, 21, 22.</p>
            <p n="12">12. The twelfth Peſtilential and highly provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Sin, is the ſin of <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and <hi>Obſtinate Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience againſt God and his Commandments,</hi> Levit. 26.23, 24, 25. And if ye will not be reformed by theſe things (ſaith the Lord) but will walk con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unto me, then will I alſo walk contrary unto you, and will puniſh you yet ſeven times for your ſins. And I will bring a ſword upon you, that ſhall avenge the quarrel of my <hi>Covenant;</hi> and when ye are gathered together within your Cities, I will ſend the <hi>Peſtilence</hi> among you, and ye ſhall be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered into the hand of the enemy. So <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.15, 16, 20, 21. If thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to obſerve to do all his Commandments, and his Statutes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe curſes ſhall come upon thee, and overtake thee; <hi>Curſed ſhalt thou be in the City, and curſed ſhalt thou be in the field,</hi> &amp;c. The Lord ſhall ſend upon thee curſing, vexation, and rebuke in all that thou ſetteſt thy hand for to do until thou be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and until thou periſh quickly. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:66159:27"/>
Becauſe of the wickedneſs of thy doings whereby thou haſt forſaken me. The Lord ſhall make the Peſtilence cleave unto thee until he hath conſumed thee, and the Lord ſhall ſmite thee with a Conſumption, and with a Feaver, and with an Inflammation, and with an extream Burning, and with the Sword, and with Blaſting, and with Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dew, and they ſhall purſue thee until thou periſh. So in the 58, <hi>and</hi> 59. <hi>verſ.</hi> If thou wilt not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to do all the words of this Law, that are written in this Book, that thou mayſt fear this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and fearful name; <hi>The Lord thy God.</hi> Then the Lord will make thy Plagues wonderful, and the Plagues of thy ſeed, even great plagues, and of long continuance; and ſore ſickneſſes, and of long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance. So <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.22, 23, 24, 25. The Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations to come when they ſhall ſee the <hi>Plagues</hi> of the Land, and the ſickneſſes which the Lord hath laid upon it; and that the whole Land is Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, and Salt, and Burning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> like the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> &amp;c. with the Lord overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath.</p>
            <p>Even all Nations ſhall ſay, <hi>Wherefore hath the Lord done this? What meaneth the heat of this great anger?</hi> Then men ſhall ſay, <hi>Becauſe they have forſaken the Covenant of the Lord God of their Fathers,</hi> &amp;c. To this agrees that of the Prophet <hi>Jerom.</hi> 29.17, 18, 19. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of hoſts, Behold, I will ſend upon them the Sword, the Famine, and the Peſtilence, and will make them like vile figgs, that cannot be eaten they are ſo vile. And I will perſecute them with the Sword, with the Famine, and with the Peſtilence, and will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them to be removed to all the Kingdomes of the Earth, to be a Curſe, and an Aſtoniſhment, and a Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:66159:28"/>
and a Reproach among all the Nations, whither I have driven them.</hi> And wherefore will the Lord be ſo ſevere againſt them? <hi>Becauſe they have not hearken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to my words, ſaith the Lord, which I ſent unto them by my ſervants the Prophets, riſing up early and ſending them; but ye would not hear, ſaith the Lord.</hi> So <hi>Ezek.</hi> 6.11. Alas for all the evil abominations of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> for they ſhall fall by the Sword, by the Famine, and by the Peſtilence; He that is far off ſhall die of the Peſtilence, and he that is near ſhall fall by the Sword, and he that remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and is beſieged, ſhall dye by the Famine. Thus will I accompliſh, ſaith the Lord, my fury upon them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7, 11. <hi>The Sword is without, and the Peſtilence and the Famine within, he that is in the Field ſhall dye with the Sword, and he that is in the City, Famine and Peſtilence ſhall devour him.</hi> And why? <hi>Violence is riſen up into a rod of wickedneſs,</hi> v. 11. The rod hath bloſſomed, pride hath budded. So <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.19, 21. If I ſend a Peſtilence into that Land, and pour out my fury upon it in bloud, to cut from it Man and Beaſt, though <hi>Noah, Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> were in it; As I live, ſaith the Lord, they ſhall deliver neither Son nor Daughter, they ſhall but deliver their own ſouls, by their righteouſneſs. For thus ſaith the Lord God, How much more when I ſent my four ſore Judgements upon <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> the Sword, and the Famine, and the noyſome Beaſt, and the <hi>Peſtilence, to cut off from it Man and Beaſt?</hi> And when will the Lord execute this great ſeverity, and be ſo inexorable the 13. <hi>verſ.</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares it, <hi>When the land ſinneth againſt me, ſaith the Lord, by treſpaſſing grievouſly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:66159:28"/>I ſhall conclude with that in the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> Chap. 2. ver. 4, 5. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, For three tranſgreſſions of</hi> Judah, <hi>and for four, I will not turn away the puniſhment thereof: Becauſe they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed the law of the Lord, and have not kept his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,</hi> &amp;c. And what follows? <hi>I will ſend a fire upon</hi> Judah, <hi>and it ſhall devour the Palaces of</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem. So <hi>Amos</hi> 4.10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I have ſent among you the Peſtilence after the manner of <hi>Egypt,</hi> your young men have I ſlain with the Sword, and have taken away your horſes, and I have made the ſtinck of your Camps to come up into your Noſtrils; yet have ye not returned unto me, ſaith the Lord. So incorrigible hard-hearted and un-reformed were they under all the ſore Judgements, that the Lord had inflicted upon them: Yet before he will make an utter deſtruction, he invites them once again to repentance. <hi>Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and becauſe I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God O</hi> Iſrael.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee what a high provoking ſin it is to rebel againſt God, and his Commandments. As <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid to <hi>Saul,</hi> when he diſobeyed the Word of the Lord. <hi>Rebellion is as the ſin of Witchcraft, and Stubornneſs is as Iniquity and Idolatry,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.23. And if God was ſo ſevere to puniſh the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions of the law, with what ſeverity will Chriſt proceed againſt the willful contemners, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyers of his Goſpel? according to that of the 2d. of the <hi>Heb.</hi> 2, <hi>and</hi> 3. <hi>verſ. If every tranſgreſſion and diſobedience, received a juſt recompence of reward,</hi> that is, of puniſhments inflicted on them: <hi>How ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great ſalvation?</hi> that is, the Goſpel, which is called a Miniſtry of the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:66159:29"/>
ſpirit and of life, whereas the law is a killing let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or the miniſtration of death and condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6, 7, 9. <hi>And the wrath of God cometh upon the children of</hi> (Goſpel) <hi>diſobedience,</hi> Epheſ. 5.6.</p>
            <p n="13">13. The thirteenth peſtilential and highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking ſin, is the ſin of <hi>Inſurrection and riſing up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lords lawful Governours and Government, whether Civil or Eccleſtaſtical, in Church or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</hi> This was the ſin of <hi>Corah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abyram</hi> and their copartners, mentioned in <hi>Num.</hi> 16. God had choſen <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> to be the cheif Leaders and Governors of his people, and placed the Government in their hands, both as to the Civil and Religious adminiſtration thereof; <hi>Korah</hi> and his companions gather themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether againſt them, and told them they took too much upon them, ſeeing all the Congregation was holy, every one of them, and that the Lord was among them, wherefore then ſhould they lift up themſelves above the Congregation of the Lord? But ſee how highly incenſing and provoking was this unto the Lord; <hi>Separate your ſelves</hi> (ſaith he to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron) from among the congregation, that I may conſume them in a moment;</hi> and now the Lord he will ſhew who are his, and who are holy, and a ſtrange work will he do; theſe men muſt not dye the common death of all men, nor be viſited after the viſitation of all men, but a new thing will the Lord make, The earth muſt open her mouth and ſwallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they muſt go down quick into the pit; and ſo they did, and the earth cloſed upon them,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:66159:29"/>
and they periſhed from among the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Nor did the puniſhment of this Inſurrection end here, but the Lord cauſes a grievous Plague to break in upon the Congregation. <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>ſaid to</hi> Aaron, in the 46. verſe, <hi>Take a cenſer and put fire therein from off the Altar, and put on Incenſe, and go quickly unto the Congregation, and make an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement for them;</hi> and why all this haſte? <hi>For there is wrath gone out from the Lord, the Plague is begun: And</hi> Aaron <hi>did ſo, and ſtood between the dead and the living, and the plague was ſtaied. Now they that died in the plague, were fourteen thouſand and ſeven hundred, beſides them that died in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of</hi> Corah; So highly diſpleaſing is it unto the Lord, for perſons to oppoſe his lawful Authority and Government which he hath put into the hands of his faithful Miniſters and Servants. Under which conſideration undoubtedly muſt thoſe Scriptures be comprehended that enjoyn ſubjection and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, whether to the Lords Civil or Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Rulers and Governors, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13, 14, 15. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.12, 13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.7, 17. O that this were ſeriouſly and timouſly conſidered and laid to heart, by all ſuch who flye in the face of Chriſt, and carry themſelves contemptuouſly againſt his lawful Governours and Government which he hath ſet in his Churches, I mean the Churches of Chriſt, making unjuſtifiable and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honorable rents, ſchiſms and diviſions in the body whereof they are members, which ſhould be as the ſeamleſs coat of Chriſt, woven from top throughout, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.23.</p>
            <p>Of ſuch who deſpiſe the Lords Government or
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:66159:30"/>
Dominion, I may ſay without wronging or inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of them, as <hi>Peter</hi> of ſome ſcandalous back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding Profeſſors in his time, who were ſpots and blemiſhes in their feaſts of Charity; <hi>Preſumptuous are they and ſelf-willed, they are not afraid to ſpeak evil of Dignities,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.10, 13. <hi>And while they promiſe themſelves liberty, they themſelves are the ſervants of corruption.</hi> verſ. 19. <hi>They deſpiſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion;</hi> The word it ſeems ſignifieth, a removing of a thing from its place, with ſome ſcorn and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: They would remove the Lords Governors or Rulers over them, with ſcorn and indignation; And whereas they are ſaid <hi>to deſpiſe dominion,</hi> that is more then to deſpiſe their Rulers; for they deſpiſe not only the Lords Governors, but the Government it ſelf. And <hi>to ſpeak evil of Dignities,</hi> or to <hi>reproach Dignities,</hi> is in the Original it ſee us to <hi>blaſpheme Glories,</hi> to ſpeak <hi>reproachfully of Dominions</hi> which are placed in glory amongſt men, or which are ſet over them by the Lord, in eminency, power, honour and authority. Hence it is that lawful Magiſtrates ruling in the fear of the Lord, are ſaid to be <hi>Gods, Pſal.</hi> 82.6. And the Lords Miniſters and Meſſengers of Churches, are ſaid to be the <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Chriſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.23. And <hi>as ſtars in his right hand are the Angels of the ſeven Churches, Rev.</hi> 1.20. All holding forth that Glory and Dignity which the Lord hath conferred upon them. And for any perſons to riſe up, as <hi>Korah</hi> and his complices did againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> though it be in a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of their own holineſs, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.3. Such are like to periſh in the gainſaying of <hi>Core,</hi> as <hi>Jude</hi> expreſſeth, verſ. 11. of his Epiſtle. It being very obſervable, how the Pſalmiſt does expreſs this act of <hi>Korah</hi>'s Inſurrection, or riſing up againſt <hi>Moſes</hi>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:66159:30"/>
and <hi>Aaron,</hi> to be no leſs then an envying of them; <hi>They envied</hi> Moſes <hi>alſo in the camp, and</hi> Aaron <hi>the Saint of the Lord. The earth opened and ſwallowed up</hi> Dathan, <hi>and covered the company of</hi> Abiram. <hi>And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burnt up the wicked,</hi> Pſa. 106.16, 17, 18. That exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple alſo of <hi>Miriam</hi> and <hi>Aarons</hi> ſpeaking againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> is not to paſs without its due obſervation neither, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.1, 7, 8, 9, 10. The Lord giving that te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of <hi>Moſes</hi> his ſervant, that he was faithful in all his houſe; <hi>Wherefore then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>were ye not afraid to ſpeak againſt my ſervant</hi> Moſes? <hi>And the anger of the Lord was kindled againſt them, and Miriam became leprous, as white as ſnow.</hi> Let ſuch therefore who are guilty in this matter, conſider how provoking a ſin this is unto the Lord, and whether they may not have a hand in pulling down this ſore viſitation among us.</p>
            <p n="14">14. A Fourteenth Peſtilential, and highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking ſin, is the ſin of <hi>Prophanation of Gods holy things,</hi> and <hi>an Over-curious, preſumptuous ſpeculation, and prying unwarrantably into the Secrets of God.</hi> This was the ſin of the men of <hi>Aſhdod,</hi> for which the hand of the Lord was ſo heavy upon them, viſiting them with greivous plagues, when they took the <hi>Ark</hi> and <hi>brought it into the houſe of Dagon</hi> (the Temple of their Idol-god) and ſet it by <hi>Dagon;</hi> ſo ſore was the hand of God on them that he ſmote them with Emrods, and deſtroyed them, and ſuch a deadly deſtruction there was throughout all the City, inſomuch that the cry of the City went up to heaven, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. The Ark was a Cheſt or Coffer, which was made of Shittim or Cedar wood, overlaid round about with gold, whoſe cover, called <hi>the Mercy-ſeat</hi> was alſo of pure gold, on which was two glorious Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubs
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:66159:31"/>
of gold, from whence God gave his oracle, <hi>Numb.</hi> 7.89. Theſe Cherubims were placed at the the two ends of the <hi>Mercy-ſeat.</hi> and they ſpread out their wings on high, which covered over the Mercy-ſeat, with their face, one to another, <hi>Exod.</hi> 37.1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9. In this were the two Tables of the Law or Teſtimony put, written with the finger of God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.16, 21. <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.3, 4, 10. Between the Cherubims God was ſaid to ſit, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.2. <hi>There will I meet with thee</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>and will commune with thee from above the Mercy-ſeat, between the two cherubims, which are upon the Ark of the Teſtimony,</hi> verſe 22. Now this Mercy-ſeat on which God did thus ſit between the wings of the Cherubims was a figure of Chriſt, by whom our tranſgreſſions of the law are forgiven and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, <hi>who is the propitiation for our ſins,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.2. And therefore called the <hi>Propitiatory, Rom.</hi> 3.15. To this glorious ſeat, where Gods preſence with his Church was manifeſted, the Throne of God is anſwerable in the Chriſtian Church, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of which Throne his people are, and ſerve him day and night in his Temple, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.15, 17.8.3.21.3, 5. Now this Ark being thus a type or figure of Chriſt and of his Church, and of his glorious preſence with the ſame, its no wonder if the Lord ſhall ſo ſeverely puniſh the prophanation of it, when men ſhall ſet it in the Temple of <hi>Dagon.</hi> Surely if the Ark ſtand there <hi>Dagon</hi> muſt fall, yea and it ſhall fall before the Ark of the Lord, which is called the Ark of his ſtrength. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132.8. And when the Ark ſet forward, then <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid, <hi>Riſe up Lord, and let thine enemies be ſcattered, and let them that hate thee flee before thee.</hi> God cannot endure
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:66159:31"/>
to have his holy things prophaned, that the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of deſolation ſhall ſtand in his holy place; that men ſhall ſet their threſholds by Gods thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſholds, and their poſts by Gods poſts, by defiling his holy name with their abominations, <hi>Wherefore</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>I have conſumed them in mine anger;</hi> No ſurely, the place of the ſoles of his feet, where he will dwell in the midſt of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for ever, and his holy name he will not ſuffer to be defiled, but he will beautifie the place of his ſanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, and make the place of his feet glorious, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.13. comp. with <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43.7, 8. Let men take heed then of offering ſtrange fire before the Lord, which he commandeth them not, leſt there comes out fire from the Lord and devoureth them; as in the caſe of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> the ſons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> who for this cauſe died before the Lord. And what ſaid <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Aaron</hi> thereupon, <hi>This is that that the Lord ſpake ſaying, I will be ſanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified,</hi> Lev. 10.1, 2, 3. So likewiſe when men will be preſumptuouſly and unwarrantably prying into the ſecrets of God, ſee how ſeverely the Lord hath puniſhed this evil; as in the caſe of the men of <hi>Beth-ſhemeſh</hi> ſaid, whom the Lord ſorely ſmote, becauſe they looked into the Ark of the Lord, even he ſmote of the people Fifty thouſand and threeſcore and ten men, and the people lamented, becauſe the Lord had ſmitten many of the people with a great ſlaughter. And the men of <hi>Beth-ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth</hi> ſaid, <hi>Who is able to ſtand before the holy Lord God?</hi> 1 Sam. 6.19, 20.</p>
            <p>So dangerous a thing it is to be over-curiouſly preſumptuous in looking into the <hi>Areana Dei,</hi> the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:66159:32"/>
ſecret and hidden things of God, which he hath not revealed. Therefore it was that the Lord had commanded, that <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſons, even they, and not others, ſhould take down the covering vail, and cover the Ark of the Teſtimony with it. And thus do unto them (ſaith the Lord) that they may live and not die, when they approach unto the moſt holy things, Aaron <hi>and his ſons ſhall go in and appoint them every one to his ſervice and to his burden. But they ſhall not go in to ſee when the holy things are covered, leſt they dye,</hi> Numb. 4.19, 20. See alſo <hi>Levit.</hi> 8.35. So exact was the Lord for the keeping of his charge. It is ſad to conſider, how wiſe ſome men have ſeemed to be above that which is written, calculating perſons, and things, and times for the meridian of their own brain; like thoſe lying Prophets which the Lord ſent not, nor ſpake unto, wherefore he complained that they propheſied unto the people a falſe viſion and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vination, even a thing of nought and the deceit of their heart, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.14. So in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>They have ſeen vanity, and lying divination, and they made others to hope, that they would confirm the word;</hi> See now the ſevere puniſhment of the Lord againſt ſuch; <hi>Behold, I am againſt you, ſaith the Lord God, and mine hand ſhall be upon the Prophets that ſee vanity, and that divine lies: they ſhall not be in the Aſſembly of my people, neither ſhall they be written in the writing of the houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>neither ſhall they enter into the land of</hi> Iſrael. But ſetting aſide ſuch groſs lying Prophets, it is ſad to think how many profeſſing the fear and knowledge of God, have been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-curiouſly prying into Gods ſecret counſels, and the hidden purpoſes of his minde, limiting,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:66159:32"/>
and preſcribing the holy one of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> advancing, and extolling the idle phantaſies, and enthuſiaſmes of their own brains, more then the declarative mind and will of God, contained in the Scriptures of truth. But whatever may be mens pretenſions to high, inward unſcriptural revelations of God, let us not be believing every ſuch ſpirit, but trying the ſpirits, whether they are of God or no; and for this reaſon, <hi>Becauſe many falſe Prophets are gone out into the world,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.1. And what ſaith <hi>Peter, We have alſo a more ſure word of propheſie</hi> (more ſure then the voice, which they heard to come from Heaven, when they were in the Holy Mount) <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto ye do well</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that ye take heed, as unto a light that ſhineth in a dark place, until the Day dawn and the Day-ſtar ariſe in your hearts,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. Ever remembring that in <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.29. <hi>That ſecret things belong unto the Lord our God: but thoſe things which are revealed, belong unto us, and to our children for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="15">15. The fifteenth and laſt thing, that I ſhall briefly ſpeak of as a Peſtilential deſtroying ſin, is that of <hi>Adding or Diminiſhing from the Word of God;</hi> for which the Lord Jeſus hath threatned ſuch dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful plagues and puniſhments. <hi>For I teſtifie (ſaith he) unto every man that heareth the words of the Propheſie of this Book. If any man ſhall add unto theſe things, God ſhall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book. And if any man ſhall take away from the words of the book of this Propheſie;</hi> What ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth then? <hi>God ſhall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy City, and from the things which are written in this book.</hi> That man
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:66159:33"/>
may be ſaid to add, that ſhall mix other things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what the Lord Jeſus hath revealed by his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel; He addeth, that adjoyneth a lye: For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is patched to the Scriptures of mens inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that it might be accounted as divinely reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or the pure Oracles of God, is a lye. Such are the Papal unwritten traditions, or other writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of men whatſoever, which are made with them of like Authority with the written word of God, and which added to the Scriptures are lies. So he takes away, that not onely derogates from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority of Gods book; but he alſo, that any ways changeth, or maliciouſly perverteth, or contradicteth any thing therein written. Chriſt will have the integrity, ſincerity, and ſacred Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of this Propheſie to be faithfully preſerved in the Churches, and that the contemners, falſifiers, and corrupters thereof, be no way ſuffered under the pain of <hi>Anathema,</hi> or dreadful curſe. For if falſifyers of Coin are lyable unto the civil curſe of the law: much more ſhall the <hi>Anathema</hi> of eternal damnation be inflicted upon the corrupters of the Scriptures, which are the words of God. <hi>Theſe with the Beaſt, and the falſe Prophet, ſhall the Lord caſt into the Lake of fire burning with brimſtone,</hi> Rev. 19.20. This is a dreadful ſin, drawing down the Lords ſevereſt plagues and puniſhments. Therefore take we heed that we add not unto the word which God commands us, nor diminiſh ought from it, but that we keep the Commandments of the Lord our God which he commandeth us, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.2, And mark well the reaſon that <hi>Solomon</hi> giveth: <hi>Every word of God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is pure, he is a ſhield to them that put their truſt in him.</hi> And conſider what follows.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:66159:33"/>Add thou not unto his words, leſt he reprove thee, and thou be found a lier, <bibl>
                  <hi>Prov. 30.5, 6.</hi>
               </bibl>
            </p>
            <p>Having now ſpoken of the ſeveral Sins which ſo highly provoke the Lord to pour down his ſore Judgements, even this of the <hi>Plague</hi> or <hi>Peſtilence</hi> among a people. I ſhall now come to ſpeak of ſome ſpecial ſpiritual Remedies, which may be fitly applied, and made uſe of, as Soveraign Antidotes and Preſervatives to prevent the further ſpreading of this peſtilential contagious diſeaſe among us.</p>
            <div n="1" type="receipt">
               <p n="1">1. THe firſt ſpiritual Receipt, that I ſhall then preſcribe unto thee, who ever thou art that getteſt in thy hand, and readeſt this little tract,</p>
               <p>Conſider ſeriouſly, and let thy thoughrs dwell long upon thoſe Sins, that I have inſiſted on, as ſuch which are the procuring Cauſe of this ſo ſore a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation from the Lord; and entring into a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſcrutiny, and examination of thine own heart and ways: Conſider how far thou haſt been, or art a partaker of thoſe ſins, which have ſo highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the Lord to ſend down this National Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Plague and Peſtilence among us. For if we ſtand guilty of the ſame Sins, how then ſhall we think to eſcape the like puniſhment? This was the way and courſe the Apoſtle took, when ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods diſpleaſure againſt the Iſraelites, whereby many of them were overthrown in the Wilderneſs; how does he bring it home by way of ſpecial application. <hi>Now theſe things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>were our Examples, to the intent we ſhould not luſt after evil things as they alſo luſted. Neither be ye Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:66159:34"/>
as were ſome of them, &amp;c. Neither let us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit fornication, as ſome of them committed, and fell in one Day three and twenty thouſand. Neither let us tempt Chriſt, as ſome of them alſo tempted, and were deſtroyed of Serpents. Neither murmure ye, as ſome of them alſo murmured, and were deſtroyed of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer. Now all things happened unto them for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples; and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5, 6, <hi>to the</hi> 11, <hi>and</hi> 12. <hi>ver.</hi> So ſay I as from the Lord. As to the firſt Peſtilentiall ſin of <hi>Oppreſſion.</hi> Did the Lord plague <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and his Land, with ſore and dreadful plagues, even this of the deſtroying Peſtilence, for his cruel oppreſſions, which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed over the bodies and conſciences of Gods people; Take heed then that thou art not found an Oppreſſor of the true worſhippers of Jeſus, the ſpiritual Iſrael of God: Take heed of exalting thy ſelf againſt God, in ſeeking ſtill to hold the ſpiritual Seed under <hi>Egyptian</hi> captivity and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. See, that thou lets them go to ſacrifice to the Lord God, as he has commanded them. Take heed of ruling over them with rigour, and making their lives bitter with hard bondage. Take heed ye rich men, that ye do not oppreſs the poor. Know that the Lord ſurely looks upon the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his people, and hears their cry by reaſon of their Task-maſters, and will come down to deliver them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.7, 8.</p>
               <p>So to thoſe that are the Biſhops, Elders, and Overſeers, the Spiritual Rulers, and Leaders of the flocks of Chriſt. Take heed that ye be not Lords over Gods heritage, but examples to the flocks: See that ye feed the flocks of God, taking
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:66159:34"/>
the overſight of them, <hi>not by conſtraint, but willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2, 3. Take heed that ye do not exerciſe a domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over their faith, but are helpers of their joy, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. Take heed that ye do not eat the fat, and cloath you with the wool, and kill them that are fed: Take heed that with force and cruelty, ye rule not over them. So then to all that oppreſs, whether in one kind or another, ſee that ye undo heavy burdens, and let the oppreſſed go free, and break every yoke; elſe, ſurely the Lord will viſit for theſe things, and his ſoul will be avenged on ſuch a Nation as this.</p>
               <p n="2">2. So for the Sin of <hi>Perſecution,</hi> and <hi>Hatred</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, and his people. Hath the Lord or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained the Arrows of his Indignation, even the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of Death againſt the Perſecutors? and will he ſtrike them into the hearts of his Enemies? O, then take heed, that thou art not found a hater of God, and a Perſecutor of the people of God, leſt the Arrow of the deſtroying Peſtilence, that flyeth at noon day, do light upon thee, and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the Lord perſecute thee.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

Then beware that thou haſt not a hand in killing, and deſtroying the Saints of the moſt high God. And take heed, that thou partake not of <hi>Babylons</hi> ſins, leſt thou receive of her plagues. <hi>For the Lord will avenge the blood of his Servants, and will render vengeance to his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:66159:35"/>
and will be merciful unto his land, and to his people,</hi> Deut. 32.43.</p>
               <p n="4">4. So for the fourth Peſtilential and highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking Sin of <hi>Idolatry.</hi> Was the anger of the Lord ſo kindled againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when <hi>Iſrael</hi> had joyned himſelf to <hi>Baal-peor,</hi> that no leſs then four and twenty thouſand died in the plague. And did the Lord plague the people, becauſe of the Calf they had made? Then beware that ye be not Idolaters as were ſome of them, and provoke the Lord to anger with your inventions. <hi>For ſurely the Lord our God is a jealous God, his glory he will not give to another, neither his praiſe to Graven Images,</hi> Iſa. 42.8.</p>
               <p n="5">5. So for the Sin of <hi>Covetouſneſs,</hi> and a greedy deſire after gain. Is it a ſin ſo abhorring unto the Lord? does the wrath of the Lord come upon the Children of diſobedience, becauſe of it? Has the Lord denounced ſo many woes againſt it? and threatned to ſmite with his plagues, and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for it? O then beware of Covetouſneſs, and being greedy of gain, <hi>leſt thou be a troubler of thine houſe,</hi> Prov. 15.27.</p>
               <p n="6">6. So for the Sin of <hi>Curſing,</hi> and <hi>Swearing,</hi> and <hi>Falſe-ſwearing.</hi> Is it, that becauſe of Swearing the Land mourns, and the Lord had a <hi>Controverſie</hi> with the Land, becauſe of it? And that the Curſer ſhall be cloathed with his Curſing, as with a Garment? and it ſhall come into his bowels like water, and the Curſe ſhall enter into the houſe of the Falſe-ſwearer? O then, beware that thou art not found in theſe ſins, leſt theſe dreadful Judgments of God fall upon thee.</p>
               <p n="7">7. So for the ſeventh Peſtilential deſtroying Sin, namely, the ſin of <hi>Adultery, Fornication,</hi> and ſuch
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:66159:35"/>
like corporeal filthineſs and uncleanneſs. Did the Lord ſo ſeverely puniſh the ſin of <hi>Zimbri</hi> and <hi>Cosby</hi> who were taken in the act of uncleanneſs, that no leſs then twenty four thouſand died in the plague? And did the Lord plague <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his houſe with great plagues, becauſe of <hi>Sarai, Abrams</hi> wife? Then beware thou beaſtly Adulterer, thou filthy Fornicator, and unclean Liver, leſt the like ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of God take hold of thee. <hi>Even as</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah, <hi>and the Cities about them, in like manner, giving themſelves over to Fornication, and going after ſtrange fleſh, are ſet forth for an example, ſuffering the vengeance of eternal fire,</hi> Jud. 7.</p>
               <p n="8">8. So for the Sin of <hi>Infidelity, Diſtruſt</hi> and <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring</hi> againſt God, the eighth provoking Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential ſin. Did thoſe men that brought up an evil report upon the good Land (diſtruſting God for all the Signs that he had ſhewed among them) dye by the plague before the Lord? And did the Carcaſſes of thoſe who murmured againſt the Lord fall in the Wilderneſs, ſo that that they could not ſee the promiſed Land? O then take heed how thou cheriſh a murmuring diſtruſting, and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiving heart againſt God. Take heed of raſing up an evil report upon the good land, thereby weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening the hands, and diſcouraging the hearts of thoſe, who would be found walking in the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful paths of the Lord, and be faithful in their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</p>
               <p n="9">9. So for the Sin of <hi>Diſcontent,</hi> loathing Gods bleſſings, and his proviſions, and luſting after evil things, to ſatisfie their inordinate deſires, the ninth provoking Peſtilential ſin. Did the Lord ſmite the people with a very great <hi>Plague,</hi> for this
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:66159:36"/>
very evil? Then take we heed that we luſt not after evil things, as they alſo luſted.</p>
               <p n="10">10. So for the Sin of <hi>Pride, Ambition,</hi> and <hi>Vain-glory,</hi> truſting in an arm of fleſh, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying on the mighty power and faithfulneſs of God. Did the Lord for this ſin of <hi>David,</hi> ſend a Peſtilence among the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſo that there dyed of the people Seventy thouſand men? O then take we heed of a proud, vain-glorious ſpirit, and that we truſt not in an arm of fleſh.</p>
               <p n="11">11. So for the Sin of <hi>Apoſtacy, Back-ſliding,</hi> and <hi>Revolting</hi> from God. Did the Lord often threaten that for this ſin he would conſume them by the Sword, the Famine, and the Peſtilence? O then take we heed that we do not Apoſtaſie, and Back-ſlide in our ſpirits from the Lord.</p>
               <p n="12">12. So for the Sin of <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and <hi>Obſtinate Diſobedience,</hi> againſt God and his Commandments. Did the Lord for this ſin threaten, that he would ſend the Peſtilence among them, and make it cleave unto them, until he had conſumed them? O then beware, that thou ſin not againſt God, and his Commands, with an Obſtinate, Rebellious, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient heart.</p>
               <p n="13">13. So for the Sin of <hi>Inſurrection,</hi> and riſing up againſt the Lords lawful Governours and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Did the Lord ſo ſeverely deal with <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> and their Complices, and Co-partners for this evil; not viſiting them after the common viſitation of men, cauſing alſo the <hi>Plague</hi> to break in among them, ſo that there died thereof, Fourteen thouſand and ſeven hundred? O then take we heed of this ſo highly provoking Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilential ſin.</p>
               <p n="14">
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:66159:36"/>14. So for the Sin of <hi>Prophanation of Gods holy things,</hi> and an Over-curious, Preſumptuous ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and prying unwarrantably into the ſecrets of God. Was the hand of the Lord ſo heavy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the men of <hi>Aſhdod,</hi> and alſo upon the men of <hi>Beth-ſhemiſh</hi> for this ſin, ſo that he ſmote them with a deadly deſtruction, even of the people, Fifty thouſand and threeſcore and ten? O then ſee that we are not guilty of this ſo highly provoking Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilential ſin.</p>
               <p n="15">15. So for the laſt Peſtilential deſtroying Sin of <hi>Adding</hi> or <hi>Diminiſhing</hi> from the word of God, for which the Lord hath threatned ſuch dreadful plagues and puniſhments. O take thou heed of this ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provoking ſin, leſt the Lord add unto thee his plagues, and take away thy part out of the Book of Life.</p>
               <p>Having now ſeriouſly conſidered, what thoſe ſins are, that ſo highly provoked the Lord to ſend down this ſore viſitation, of the Plague or Peſtilence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a people ſee I ſay, that thou enter then into a diligent ſearch, and examination of thine own heart and ways to find out the ſin or ſins, which thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſhall tell thee thou ſtandeſt guilty of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord: Whether it be the ſin of <hi>Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Perſecution, Murder, Idolatry, Adultery, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, Curſing</hi> or <hi>Swearing, Infidelity, Diſcontent, Pride, Apoſtacy, Diſobedience,</hi> or any other of the forementioned provoking evils. And ſee that thou art very exact, and not ſlight, and ſuperficial, in this manner of ſelf-examination. This is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation of the Lord, by his Prophet <hi>Zephaniah,</hi> Chap. 2.1, 2. <hi>Gather your ſelves together, yea; ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:66159:37"/>
together, O, Nation not deſired:</hi> thus is it ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in our Tranſlation, but other Traſlations read it thus: <hi>Search your ſelves narrowly, yea ſearch your ſelves narrowly, O people, not worthy to be deſired. Before the Decree bring forth, before the day paſs as the chaff, before the fierce anger of the Lord come upon you.</hi> I finde the Hebrew word ſignifies thus much; Firſt, To gather your wits together, that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore diſperſed upon vanity. Secondly, To frame your ſelves to purge away your ſpiritual chaff. Thirdly, To ſearch narrowly, as for a loſt jewel, or hid mine. The true ſence is, Enter into your ſelves; ſearch, try and examine all your ways and doings, that ye may rightly underſtand how hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily and greivouſly God muſt needs be offended with your great and manifold ſins. And mark the reaſon why they ſhould be ſo diligent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious in this work; <hi>Before the Decree bring forth:</hi> That is, before that doth come to paſs, which is decreed by God againſt you; Gods De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree is then ſaid to bring forth, when it cometh to be executed. As the bringing forth of a woman doth not follow preſently after the conception, but in the appointed due time: So alſo is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God not brought to light, by the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, until the time determined and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Before the day paſs as the chaff]</hi> that is, very ſwiftly, ſuddenly, like chaff, the day is paſſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, therefore whiles ye have time yet, before the day that runs and wears away ſo faſt, does bring forth the Decree, produce and make appear what God hath decreed againſt you. O Nation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſirable, ſearch your ſelves, yea ſearch your ſelves
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:66159:37"/>
very narrowly, whiles the heat of the Lords wrath doth not yet come upon you; whiles the day of the Lords wrath doth not yet take hold of you. This is further inculcated and preſt by the Lord in the Propheſie of the Prophet <hi>Haggai,</hi> chap. 1.5, 7. <hi>Is it a time for you, O ye, to dwell in your ceiled houſes</hi> (that is, in your ſtately and ſumptuous houſes, for pleaſure and delight) <hi>and this houſe lye waſte,</hi> or deſolate, meaning the Lords houſe: <hi>Now therefore, thus ſaith the Lord of of Hoſts, Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your ways;</hi> Or which is more agreeable to the Original, <hi>Set your heart upon your ways:</hi> Obſerve and conſider well how it fares with you, by reaſon of your ſins. Had they conſidered, or ſet their hearts aright upon their ways, this might have prevented the execution of Gods judgements mentioned the 9, 10, and 11, verſes thereof. For want of this the Lord by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ch. 1. takes up a bitter lamentation and complaint; <hi>Hear O Heavens, and give ear O Earth; for the Lord hath ſpoken: I have nouriſhed and brought up children, and they have rebelled againſt me. The Ox knoweth his ower, and the Aſs his maſters ſcrib: but</hi> Iſrael <hi>doth not know, my people</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>doth not conſider.</hi> They were more brutiſh and void of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding then the beaſts or brute creatures. For want of this conſideration it was, <hi>that every one turned to his courſe of ſin, as the horſe ruſheth into the battel,</hi> breaking and running through like a water flood, as the word is properly uſed. And why? <hi>Becauſe no man ſaid What have I done?</hi> And the Lord complaineth further, <hi>That the Stork in the Heaven knew her appointed times, and the Turtle, and the Crane, and the Swallow did obſerve the time of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:66159:38"/>
their coming, but his people knew not the judgement of the Lord,</hi> Jer. 8.6, 7. This is that conſideration which we ought to have of our ſelves: But what ſtrangers are moſt men and women to their own hearts? who enters into ſuch a ſerious thought as to ſay, <hi>What have I done?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seneca</hi> reporteth of <hi>Sexius,</hi> how every night before he ſlept he asked his own heart, <hi>What evil this day haſt thou amended? what vice haſt thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted? in what part art thou bettered?</hi> Surely ſuch a courſe as this, would prevent the fearleſs and heedleſs running into many groſs enormities and ſins; and ſo prevent the ruine and deſtruction of many a poor ſinful ſoul. This courſe the Church took in the <hi>Lamentations, Wherefore doth the living man complain? a man for the puniſhment of his ſins? Let us ſearch and try our ways, and turn again un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord,</hi> Lam. 3.39, 40. Fall then in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt upon this work of ſelf-examination; and think it better to know thine own infirmites, and thy ſoul-ſickneſſes and ſores, then to know the whole world, and all the wonders thereof; It is one of the beſt parts of wiſdom to know thy ſelf: This will beat down thy pride, and keep the humble, and lead thee to the true knowledge of God; It will caſt out and keep out ſin, and preſerve thee from many temptations; It is the beginning and foundation of grace and repentance, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.40. And will prevent the ſevere ſtroak of Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as in that of <hi>Zephany</hi> 2.1, 2. And ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>If we will judge our ſelves, we ſhall not be judged of the Lord,</hi> Surely did we but know what the heart of man is, while unregenerate and in its natural eſtate; what a ſink, a ſea of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:66159:38"/>
ſin and filthineſs it is; how deceitful above all things and deſperately wicked, as <hi>Jeremy</hi> hath it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9. what infinite intricate windings and turnings there are in the dark laborinths of mans heart; what a multitude of vain thoughts do lodge within it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4 14. What ſwarms of luſts and uncleaneſs iſſue out from this corrupt and putrified fountain, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.34. comp. with chap. 15.18, 19, verſes. What a deal of ſelf-ſophiſtry and impoſture is wrapt up there, by which millions of ſouls are inwraped in the ſnares and ſhackels of Satan; I ſay did we right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know, and were not ſtrangers to theſe things, it might put us on with all ſeriouſneſs and readineſs this ſo weighty and profitable a work.</p>
               <p>But O where is the man almoſt, that knows, or ſets himſelf in good earneſt for to know and find out the Plague of his own heart! O what a many of <hi>Plague-ſores,</hi> and <hi>running iſſues</hi> are in the hearts of men and women at this day, and yet they are inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of them. Every one almoſt is ſenſible of the Plague-tokens, or ſores when they ſeize upon the body, and moſt people fear and dread this contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſeaſe, becauſe of the loathſomneſs of it, but for the Plague of the Heart, the Soul-ſickneſs and ſores, O where is there any knowledge or diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it! where is there any ſenſe of the loathſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and infectiouſneſs of it! And yet without this, how can we expect a healing? and the removal of this ſevere ſtroke of the Lord? according to <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> prayer, at the dedication of the Temple, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.37, 38, 39. <hi>If there be in the land famine, if there be peſtilence, &amp;c. whatſoever plague, whatſoever ſickneſs there be: what prayer and ſupplication ſoever be made by any man, or by all the people</hi> Iſrael (and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:66159:39"/>
mark what follows?) <hi>which ſhall know every man the plague of his own heart, and ſpread forth his hands towards this houſe: Then hear thou in Heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and do, and give to every man according to his ways, whoſe heart thou knoweſt (for thou, even thou onely knoweſt the hearts of the children of men.)</hi> Now this prayer of <hi>Solomon</hi> had its confirmation from the Lord, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 9.3. So that this knowledge of the Plague of the heart, is a neceſſary qualification or ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to go along with that prayer, which ſhall be prevailing with the Lord for the removal of the Peſtilence out of the land or Nation wherein it is. But if the men of this generaration are ſtill unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the plagues or ſores of their own heart, if they be ſtill as vain, as proud, as oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, as Superſtitious, as Idolatrous, as Adulterous, as Murderous, as Blaſphemous, as Rebellious and Diſobedient againſt the Lord and his commands, as reviling and perſecuting the way of truth and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as ever, can it be expected that the hand of the Lord ſhould be removed, or the fire of his his indignation, which now burns ſo very hot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, ſhould be quenched?</p>
               <p>Set thy ſelf then in good earneſt upon this heart-ſearching work, whoever thou art that would eſcape this ſevere ſtroke of the Lord. And if thou knoweſt not how to deal with thy heart, it is ſo treacherous and vile, put up <hi>Davids</hi> prayer unto the Lord. in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.23, 24. <hi>Search me O God, and know my heart, try me and know my thoughts; And ſee if there be any way of wickedneſs in me, and lead me in the way everlaſting.</hi> If there be any pernicious, hurtful, or oppreſſing way in me; and lead me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:66159:39"/>
the way of eternity, upon that way which may lead me to eternal life. But know, that if thou wilt be careleſs and neglectve ſtill of this ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary a work, and put the Lord upon it, he will then make a very ſtrict and diligent ſearch, and ſee what will be the ſad event and conſequent of it, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1.12. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs at that time, that I will ſearch Jeruſalem with candles, and puniſh the men that are ſettled on their lees, that ſay in their heart, The Lord will not do good, neither will he do evil.</hi> And what follows? <hi>Therefore their goods ſhall become a booty, and their houſes a deſolation: they ſhall alſo build houſes, but not inhabit them; and they ſhall plant vineyards, but not drink the wine thereof. Then the mighty man ſhall cry bitterly. And God wyll bring diſtreſs upon men, that they ſhall walk as blind men, becauſe they have ſinned againſt the Lord, and their blood ſhall be poured out as duſt, and their fleſh as the dung, and at that time, neither their their ſilver nor their gold ſhall be able to deliver them in the day of the Lords wroth, but the whole land ſhall be devoured by the fire of his jealouſie: For he ſhall make even a ſpeedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land.</hi> And when is this time that the Lord will make this ſtrict and diligent ſearch as with candles? ver. 7. declares it, It is in the day of the Lord, when he prepareth a ſacrifice, and ſhall bid his gueſts. And in that day of the Lords ſacrifice, then will be puniſh the Princes, and the Kings children, and all ſuch as are cloathed with ſtrange apparel, that leap on the threſhold, and fill their Maſters houſes with deceit. O <hi>England,</hi> then be exhorted to conſider thy ways, that thou mayſt find out thy hideous provoking abominations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:66159:40"/>
the Lord make a ſpeedy riddance. This is the firſt ſpiritual Receit I would preſcribe unto thee.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="receipt">
               <head>The Second Receit.</head>
               <p>Having, made this diligent ſearch lnto thine own heart, and found out thy ſoul-peſtilent ſores, then the next ſpiritual Receit I ſhall preſcribe unto thee, <hi>Is a good draught of a ſound and ſincere Repentance:</hi> Which if ſound and ſincere will ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate theſe four things in thee;</p>
               <p>Firſt, A kindly mourning in ſecret before the Lord, 1. For thine own iniquities. 2. For the ſins and abominations of the times.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It will breed a hatred and abhorrency in thy heart againſt thoſe evils, together, with an humble confeſſion and acknowledgement of them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A willing forſaking, and renunciation of them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, A returning unto the Lord with all thy heart. Surely as to this Receit, we may write a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batum eſt,</hi> its a tried Receit, a ſure Remedy, a ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Plaiſter for this running ſore. <hi>Repent and turn your ſelves from all your trangreſſions (ſaith the Lord) ſo iniquity ſhall not be your ruine,</hi> Ezek. 18.30. So in <hi>v.</hi> 32. <hi>Turn your ſelves, and live ye; for why will ye die O houſe of</hi> Iſrael? But more particularly to the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral branches of Repentance as they are laid down.</p>
               <p>Firſt, then ſee, that the true ſenſe of thy ſin does work thy heart to a kindly mourning and ſorrowing for the ſame in ſecret before the Lord. This ſorrow and contrition for ſin, will I ſay, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the ſoundneſs and ſincerity of thy Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, when thou canſt mourn before the Lord, not
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:66159:40"/>
onely in reſpect of the danger which thou haſt incurred by reaſon of thy ſins, to wit, the curſes of this life, temporal death, and eternal plagues and torments in another world, but alſo that thou haſt ſo unkindly grieved and provoked ſo good a God, ſo compaſſionate a Father, ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious a Redeemer, ſo bleſſed a Sanctifier, and incurred the loſs of ſo great a God, even the favour of ſo good and gracious a God, that taketh no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11. This is that godly ſorrow, that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10, 11. that worketh repentance to ſalvation, not to be repented of; the notable effects whereof are there alſo demonſtrated and declared; which will be of ſuch ſingular efficacy and force to quench the fire of the Lords indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and wrath, now broken out among us. In the ſeventh of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> the Lord threatning the final deſolation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> telling her that her end was come, and that he would judge her accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her ways, and recompence upon her all her abominations; <hi>That the Sword was without, and the Peſtilence and Famine within;</hi> and that he that was in the field, ſhould die with the ſword; and that he that was in the City, Famine and Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence ſhould devour him. In verſe 16. he tells us <hi>That they that eſcape of them</hi> (meaning thoſe that ſhould eſcape the common calamity of the Sword, Peſtilence and Famine) <hi>they ſhall be on the mountains like Doves of the valleys, all of them mourning every one for his iniquity:</hi> that is, for his own iniquity ſhall every one mourn as Doves of the valleys. The word ſignifieth a making a ſtir by ſighing, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and howling.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:66159:41"/>So <hi>Hezekiah</hi> in the time of his ſickneſs, tells us, <hi>That he did mourn as a Dove,</hi> Iſa. 38.14. Such will be the gratious temper and diſpoſition of ſoul of the Lords eſcaped ones: They ſhall mourn every one for his own iniquity, as Doves in the Valleys, in their ſecret retirements with the Lord; the ſence and remembrance of their ſins, in diſhonouring and grieving ſo good and gratius a God, will make them to ſob and ſigh, and even to howl before the Lord. So did <hi>Ephraim,</hi> when he repented, and turned unto the Lord. <hi>I have ſurely heard Ephraim</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>bemoaning himſelf,</hi> Jer. 31.18. In this ſpirit and temper will the Loeds eſcaped remnant be found in.</p>
               <p>So in <hi>Iſraels</hi> reſtauration, when the Lord ſhall gather them from the Coaſts of the Earth, in what ſpirit ſhall they then be found? <hi>They ſhall come with weeping</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>and with ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications will I lead them,</hi> as in the 9th. <hi>verſ.</hi> of the ſame <hi>Chap.</hi> with weeping for their ſins, and with ſupplications or petitions unto the Lord for mercy and pardon. And ſuitable to this, is that in the 3d. of <hi>Zephan.</hi> 18. <hi>I will gather them that are ſorrowful</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>for the ſolemn aſſembly, to whom the reproach of it was a burden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe that are ſad and ſorrowful, becauſe they are obſtructed and hindered from meeting in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, in the Aſſemblies of his Saints, for the ſolemn worſhip and ſervice of God; when they muſt converſe with and among ſuch ſcoffing Companions, which make but a mock and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of God and his Word. In this gratious tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and frame of ſpirit was <hi>David</hi> in, when he could not perform the fervent deſire he had to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:66159:41"/>
ſerve God among the faithful. How bitterly does he bemoan his being deprived of the comfort of the publick worſhip of God, during his exile, and the blaſphemies of his enemies, which cauſed his ſpirit even to be overwhelmed? <hi>As the Hart panteth after the water brooks, ſo panteth my ſoul after thee, O God. My ſoul thirſteth for God, for the living God: when ſhall I come and appear before God.</hi> Meaning in the Houſe of the Lord, the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle where the ſolemn worſhip of God was cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated, and the Ark of the Covenant was, where God dwelled, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.2. or where the Lord gave viſible ſigns of his preſence. And mark what follows? <hi>My tears</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>have been my meat day and night, while they continually ſay unto me, Where is thy God?</hi> His tears were as his bread, he fed and fillid himſelf with tears, as if they were his onely food and ſuſtenance, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that in the 80. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5. <hi>Thou feedeſt them with the bread of tears, and giveſt them tears to drink in great meaſure.</hi> Meaning his own people often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, who are at his very foot, praying and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating at the throne of grace.</p>
               <p>And ſuch a frame of ſpirit ſhall be found alſo in them, as ſhall ask the way to <hi>Zion,</hi> with their faces thitherward; <hi>They ſhall be going and weeping,</hi> and in this ſpirit of mourning they ſhall go and ſeek the Lord their God. All which doth evidently ſhews forth, what will be the temper and ſpirit of all right-repenting ſouls, and what a frame of ſpirit the Lord expects his people to be found in, when his hand is lifted up, even in this time, when he ſends the deſtroying Peſtilence among us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:66159:42"/>Now conſider in what frame of ſpirit art thou before the Lord this day; Haſt thou found thy heart broken as it were into ſhivers for thy ſins? Has the ſight of thy ſins made thee to ſigh for thy ſins, and to mourn kindly before the Lord for thine iniquities? Haſt thou ever ſhed a tear before the Lord for thy ſecret ſins? or thy more open and notorious abominations? Surely, if in ſuch a day as this, when the Arrows of the Lords Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation are flying abroad, if thou ſhalt be found in a Carnal, Light, Frothly, Frolick, Voluptuous, Vain-ſpirit; a lover of thy pleaſures more then a lover of God, putting far away from thee the evil day, and cauſing the ſeat of violence to come near; like thoſe the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> complains of, <hi>Who were at eaſe in</hi> Sion, <hi>and truſted in the Mountain of</hi> Samaria, <hi>That lay upon Beds of Ivory, and ſtretcht them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon their Couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midſt of the ſtall, That did chaunt to the ſound of the viol; and invent to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves inſtruments of Muſick:</hi> like <hi>David, That drank wine in bowls, and anointed themſelves with the chief oyntment, but were not grieved for the affliction of</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph. I ſay, if in ſuch a day as this, under ſuch a ſevere and ſore viſitation as this, thou ſhalt be found in ſuch a ſpirit and temper as this, ſad and deplorable will thy condition be.</p>
               <p>For mark what the Lord threatned thoſe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, fleſhly, ſenſual rejoycing ones. <hi>Therefore now ſhall they go captive, with the firſt that go captive, and the banquet of them that ſtretched themſelves ſhall be removed,</hi> Amos 6.1. <hi>to the</hi> 8. <hi>verſ.</hi> So dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and highly provoking a ſin, when the preſent diſpenſations of God, together with thine
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:66159:42"/>
own perſonal evils, do call for a mournful frame of ſpirit, that then thou ſhouldſt be found in a ſpirit of carnal merriment and rejoycing. As the Lord complained by the Prophet <hi>Iſa. Chap.</hi> 22.12. <hi>In that day did the Lord God of Hoſts call to weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and mourning, and to baldneſs, and to girding with ſackcloth; and behold joy, and gladneſs, ſlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Oxen, and killing Sheep; eating fleſh, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wine: Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we ſhall dye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This they ſpake in a ſcoffing manner, as if they had ſaid, our Prophet tells us, that we ſhall ſoon be deſtroyed, and ſlain, or carried into captivity; let us then be jovial and merry, as long as we may. But mark, how hainouſly did the Lord take it at their hands. <hi>And it was revealed in mine ears by the Lord of Hoſts, Surely this iniquity ſhall not be purged from you, till ye dye, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Meaning that it ſhould never be forgiven unto them, unleſs they did ceaſe from ſinning. For ſo the word <hi>till,</hi> or untill, in Scripture phraſe does uſually hold forth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.15. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.23. <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.25.</p>
               <p>I ſhall add hereunto that in the Prophet <hi>Joel, Chap.</hi> 2d. where the Prophet ſetting forth the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribleneſs of Gods approaching Judgements, in the 12th. <hi>verſ.</hi> he exhorteth them to this repenting, and relenting frame of ſpirit, as the only means to pacifie the Lords wrath and indignation, from breaking out againſt them, or for the removal of it. <hi>Therefore alſo now, ſaith the Lord, Turn ye even to me, with all your heart, and with faſting, and with weeping, and with mourning: and rent your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the Lord
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:66159:43"/>
your God, for he is gratious and merciful, ſlow to anger, and of great kindneſs, and repenteth him of the evil.</hi> So in the 15. <hi>verſ. Blow the Trumpet in</hi> Sion, <hi>ſanctifie a faſt, call a ſolemn aſſembly, gather the people, ſanctifie the Congregation,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Let the Prieſts, the Miniſters of the Lord, weep between the Porch and the Altar; and let them ſay, Spare thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, O Lord, and give not thy heritage to reproach.</hi> And mark what follows, <hi>Then will the Lord be jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for his land, and pity his people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was that ſpirit alſo that was found in the people of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> when deſtruction was threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon <hi>Jonahs</hi> preaching, <hi>Jonah</hi> 3.5, 6, 7, 8. It is ſaid, they believed God, and proclaimed a Faſt, and put on ſackcloth from the greateſt of them even to the leaſt, yea, the King himſelf aroſe from his throne, and laid his robe from him, and covered him with ſackcloth, and ſat in aſhes; and cauſed it to be proclaimed, that man and beaſt ſhould be covered with ſackcloth, and cry mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto God, and turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that was in their hands: and (ſaith he) who can tell, if God will turn, and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger that we periſh not? And God ſaw their works, that they turned from their evil way, and God repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the evil, that he had ſaid, that he would do unto them, and he did it not.</p>
               <p>See what ſignal demonſtrations were there here, of the inward ſorrow and compunction of their hearts. O how will this Example of <hi>Nineveh</hi> repenting and ſorrowing for their ſins, riſe up in judgement againſt the men of this generation! <hi>Luk.</hi> 11, 32. Where is the covering of ſackcloth to be ſeen?
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:66159:43"/>
Any outward demonſtrations of a relenting ſpirit to be diſcerned? Where can we ſee the mournful ſoul that is deeply afflicted for its ſins, under this ſore viſitation of the Lord? Are not men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as proud, and vain, and carnal, and jovial now as before? Is there any crying mightily unto God? Any turning from their evil way, or from the violence that is in their hands? Do we ſee any looſing of the bands of wickedneſs? undoing the heavy burdens? the letting the oppreſſed go free? and the breaking of every yoke? And where are any bowels of compaſſions drawn out toward the poor and needy? but in vain are all faſtings, and formal devotions, if theſe things are neglected which are eſſential as to that acceptable faſt which God hath choſen, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.6, 7. See then that ye be true mourners in <hi>Sion,</hi> and let the ſence of thine inquities work in thee a true contrition, and brokenneſs of heart. <hi>For the Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart, and ſaveth ſuch as be of a contrite ſpirit,</hi> Pſal. 38.18. This is the heart that he will heal, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.3. The heart that he will bind up, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1. That Evangelical ſacrifice which he will not deſpiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.17.</p>
               <p>Now to get thy heart melted into this mournful frame. Take theſe helps.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Be looking up unto Chriſt, whom by thy ſins thou haſt peirced, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Apply the New Covenant-promiſes, for the taking away of the ſtony heart out of thy fleſh, and the Lords giving of thee an heart of fleſh, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.19. <hi>and</hi> 36.26.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Get a ſence of the unſpeakable miſery thou art lyable unto by reaſon of thy ſins, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:66159:44"/>
whether it be Pride, Oppreſſion, Idolatry, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, Apoſtacy, Curſing, and Swearing, or ſuch other of thoſe peſtilential ſins before mentioned; or whether they be lies, railings, ſcoffings at Gods people, rotten ſpeeches, bedlam paſſions, goods ill-gotten, time ill-ſpent, prophanation of the Lords-day.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Conſider alſo, that thy heart hath been the Fountain, or rather the Sinck, from whence hath iſſued many foul ſtreams, where all ill hath been forged, all evil words, and wicked thoughts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred, then by the rule of proportion let thy heart be a fountain of ſorrow for ſin.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Conſider the heart of Chriſt, he had not taken a heart of fleſh, but for ſin; which for thy ſake was filled with that unexpreſſible ſorrow and greif, that if all the godly ſorrow of all the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſouls, from the beginning of the world to the end thereof, in heaven and in earth, dead or alive, were collected into one heart, they could not countervail the depth of his anguiſh. And ſhall his bleſſed ſoul fall aſunder in his bleſſed breaſt, aſſaulted with all the wrath of God, and the moſt dreadful torments of Hell? ſhall his ſoul be like a ſcorched hearth, and ſo preſſed with the flames of Gods revenging wrath, which wrung from him thoſe bloody drops, and ruful crys. <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> And ſhall thy heart be as a ſtone within thy breaſt, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be moved? Oh, prodigious hardneſs, and worſe then heatheniſh ingratitude!</p>
               <p n="6">6. Conſider if thy heart be not wounded here in this world, in ſome meaſure truly, it ſhall hereafter be filled with ſuch endleſs honour, that
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:66159:44"/>
it would grieve and break ten thouſand hearts to imagine or think of it. Is it not better then, to mourn a little here in this life for ſin, then to have our hearts inlarged to endure to all eternity, the extremity of the wrath of God, in the unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible horrour of hell? Is any man ſo ſenſleſs, to think he ſhall go to heaven in a bed of down, and never be touched for his ſins? When <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah,</hi> a man of a perfect heart, complained and chattered like a Crane, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.14. When <hi>David</hi> a man after Gods own heart, roared all the day long, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.3. When <hi>Job</hi> a perfect and a juſt man, complained that the Arrows of the Almighty were within him, and that the venome thereof did drink up his ſpirit, <hi>Job</hi> 6.4. Nay when Chriſt himſelf, that holy and juſt one, that pure and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate Lamb, did ſo cry our, in the agony and bitterneſs of his ſpirit.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Conſider again, that if thou getſt this broken heart into thy breaſt, thou ſhalt bring down the glorious Majeſty of Heaven, God Almighty with his Chair of State to ſit in thy ſoul. For he hath a twofold habitation, to wit, heaven, and the humble heart, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.15.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Add hereunto the practiſe of the Saints of God. They poured out tears as men do water out of Buckets, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.6. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> waſhed Chriſts feet with her tears, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.14. The Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican ſtrook on his breaſt, with a ſorrowful acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of his ſins, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.13. And ſurely, if thy hands and eyes, and tongue and heart, have been inſtruments of Gods diſhonour; then by the Rule of proportion, thou ſhouldſt have the works of thy hands, inſtrumental demonſtrations of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:66159:45"/>
Thine eyes fountains of tears, and thy tongue uttering, and thy heart ſuffering greif. And if for outward lolles and croſſes, thou canſt weep tears, as <hi>David</hi> for his Son <hi>Abſalom?</hi> and with what wringing of hands, tearing of hair, bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter crying, do many expreſs the inward, and intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable ſorrow, and greif of their hearts? Then certainly the loſs of Chriſt, and of the favour of God, which is infinitely better then Husband, Wife, Child, or any the moſt deſireable thing in the world, how ſhould this break thy heart, and draw tears from thy ſoul?</p>
               <p>Thus having got thy heart melted into this mournful frame, out of a deep ſence, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of thine own ſins. Then,</p>
               <p>Secondly, Thou wilt come to mourn kindly, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the accompt of the common ſins, and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the times. As <hi>David</hi> in the 119. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 136. <hi>verſ. Rivers of waters</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>run down mine eyes,</hi> and why? <hi>becauſe, they keep not thy law.</hi> Or as others read it. Mine eyes guſh out with ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of waters, I weep and ſhed abundance of tears, even for the wickeds ſake whom I pity; and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, for the law of God, which greiveth me to the heart to ſee violated and broken. So the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Jeremy, Oh that my head</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>were wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night, for the ſlain of the Daughter of my people. O that I had in the wilderneſs a lodging place of wayfaring men, that I might leave my people and go from them;</hi> Why? what is the matter good <hi>Jeremy</hi> of this ſo ſad and mournful a wiſh? and that thou wouldſt leave thy people, and go from them? Why? there is cauſe and reaſon enough,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:66159:45"/>
might he ſay. <hi>They be all Adulterers, an Aſſembly of treacherous men. And they bend their tongues like their bow for lies: but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth, for they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.1, 2, 3. So deeply was the ſoul of this good Prophet of the Lord affected and afflicted, upon the account of the publique National abominations, and defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>In like manner it is ſaid of righteous and juſt <hi>Lot,</hi> that he was vexed with the filthy converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the wicked (meaning the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> among whom he lived.) <hi>For that righteous man dwelling among them</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>in ſeeing, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, vexed his righteous ſoul, from day to day, with their unlawful deeds,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7, 8. He lived among abominable men, that cared neither for right nor reaſon, and this greived and tormented his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſoul, as if it had been upon a rack, as the word implies. So it is ſaid of our dear Lord, that he was greived for the hardneſs of their hearts, <hi>Mark.</hi> 3.5. But to bring it more cloſe to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent viſitation of the Lord, and what a ſpecial preſervative and antidote this gratious qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſoul is for the keeping off, of this ſevere ſtroke of the Lord: Look into <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9. even the whole Chapter; there you ſhall find, <hi>that the Man who was cloathed with linnen, which had the Writers Inckhorn by his ſide, was commiſſionated from the Lord, to go through the midſt of the City, through the midſt of Jeruſalem, and ſet a Mark upon the Foreheads of the men that did ſigh, and cry for all the abominations that were done in the midſt thereof.</hi> And after him follows the men, who had the ſlaughter weapons in their
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:66159:46"/>
hands, and they were to go through the City and ſmite, and ſlay utterly old and young, both Maids and little Children, and Women, but not to come near any man upon whom was the Mark. God had a remnant among this wicked and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding generation, and they muſt be firſt marked, and theſe are deſcribed to be ſuch, as did ſigh and cry for all the abominations of the times, and all that time the iniquity of the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> was exceeding great, the Land was full of blood, and the City full of perverſneſs, and what other their abominations were, the Chapter before doth evidently declare it.</p>
               <p>In like manner when the Paſsover was to be inſtituted was the blood of the Lamb to be a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> upon the houſes were they were; So that the Lord ſeeing the blood that was ſtruck upon the door-poſts did paſs over them, and ſuffered not the Deſtroyer to come in and ſmite them, when he ſmote the land of <hi>Egypt.</hi> The Plague was not to come upon the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to deſtroy them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.12, 13, 22, 23. Well then, wilt thou be of the number of Gods marked ones, that the Deſtroying Angel may paſs over thee, and the plague come not upon thee, when God is ſmiting the land, as now he is, by the deſtroying Peſtilence: O ſee then that thy heart is brought into this holy frame, to ſigh and mourn not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for thine own perſonal evils, but alſo for the crying ſins and abominations of the times. But ſurely, if thou canſt ſwim down with the ſtream of the times, and hear the holy and precious name of God diſhonoured and blaſphemed daily, his Spirit derided, his Saints and Ordinances villified
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:66159:46"/>
and defamed, his Meſſengers abuſed, and the way of Holineſs reproached. Or if thou canſt behold wickedneſs walking up and down with a bold, impudent forehead, and men and women of a fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, impure, ſpotted converſation, and not ſhed one tear, nor ſigh and mourn under ſuch National abominations; ſurely it argues, that the grace of ſaving and ſound Converſion and Repentance was never yet effectually wrought in thy ſoul; if ſo, thou canſt not but mourn under the ſence of ſin, whether in thy ſelf or in any other. The want of which temper and ſpirit, in the caſe of the Inceſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons perſon, made the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to reprehend the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> telling them, that they were puffed up, and had not rather <hi>mourned, that be that had done that deed, might be taken away from among them,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.1, 2. Well then if you would be Gods marked ones, ſee that you be <hi>Sions</hi> mourning ones, remembring what our dear Lord hath left on record, for the abundant ſatisfaction and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch ſorrowful ſouls, <hi>Bleſſed are they that mourn, for they ſhall be comforted,</hi> Mat. 5.4. It is taken generally for a mourning or ſorrowing for ſin, as it ſtands in oppoſition with a ſpirit of jollity and voluptuous living, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.19, 25. Such ſhall be comforted, they ſhall never miſs of outward and inward comforts. <hi>They that ſow in tears, ſhall reap in joy,</hi> Pſal. 126.5. Their ſorrow ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſed with gladneſs. For to this end was Chriſt anointed to his Office of Mediatorſhip; <hi>That he might comfort all that mourn,</hi> whether up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of ſin on the miſeries of <hi>Sion, To appoint unto them that mourn in Sion, to give unto them beauty for aſhes;</hi> beautiful garments, goodly
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:66159:47"/>
apparel, inſtead of aſhes, which they were wont to ſtrew upon their heads, and ſit in them when they mourned, as a teſtification of their exceſſive ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and greif, <hi>Job</hi> 1.8. <hi>Jonah.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.21. The oyle of joy for mourning, the garment of praiſe for the ſpirit of heavineſs; by which we are to underſtand, the beautiful, reſplendent, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing gifts and graces of the ſpirit of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.9. <hi>That they might be called trees of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the planting of the Lord that he might be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> Iſa. 61.2, 3. Oak-trees of righteouſneſs, trees of the greateſt ſtrength and duration, by which is meant, that thoſe that are ingrafted into Chriſt by faith; and ſuch are all true mourners in <hi>Sion,</hi> they ſhall not only bring forth fruits of righteouſneſs, but they ſhall alſo have firme, dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and permanent conſolation, and ſtrength in Chriſt. <hi>Everlaſting joy ſhall be upon their heads, and ſorrow, and mourning ſhall flee away,</hi> Iſa. 51.11.</p>
               <p>Secondly. If thy repentance be ſincere, and ſound, and ſuch as will ſtand thee in ſtead in a cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitous day; It will then work in thee a true hatred, and abhorrency of all manner of evil. <hi>Job</hi> abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelf, and repented in duſt and aſhes, <hi>Job</hi> 42.6. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o in the 40. of <hi>Job</hi> and the 4. <hi>verſe. Behold I am vile, what ſhall I anſwer thee; I will lay my hand upon my mouth. Wo is me</hi> (ſaith the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah) for I am undone, becauſe I am a man of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean lips, and I dwell in the midſt of a people of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean lips,</hi> Iſa. 6.5. But to come more cloſe, as to the preſent diſpenſation, and viſitation of the Lord. In the 6th. of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> The Lord having threatned the Peſtilence among other his ſore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying Judgments, and how the ſlain ſhould fall
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:66159:47"/>
in the midſt of them, He promiſeth nevertheleſs, that he will leave a remnant that ſhould eſcape the Sword among the Nations. And how muſt this remnant be qualified? What thoughts and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions ſhall they have of themſelves, by reaſon of their abominable ſins? See the 9. <hi>verſe</hi> of that <hi>Chapter. And they that eſcape of you</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>ſhall remember me among the Nations, whither they ſhall be carried Captives; becauſe, I am broken with their whoriſh heart, which hath departed from me; and with their eyes, which go a whoring after their Idols.</hi> And what follows? <hi>They ſhall loath themſelves for the evils which they have committed in all their abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> So in the 36. of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> ſpeaking of the reſtauration of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> how that he will take them from among the Heathen, and gather them out of all Countries, and bring them into their own Land, and ſave them from all their uncleanneſſes, in the 11. <hi>verſe. Then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall ye remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber your evil ways, and your doings that were not good, and ſhall loath your ſelves in your own ſight, for your iniquities, and for your abominations.</hi> This ſhall be the temper and ſpirit of the Lords eſcaped remnant, they ſhall loath themſelves in their own ſight for their iniquities, or for all the evils that they have committed, as it is <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.43. They ſhall even abhor and deteſt themſelves for their iniquities, which will appear ſo odious, filthy, and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in their ſight. As the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> loathed the Manna in contempt, counting it baſe or vile, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with other meats, <hi>Num.</hi> 25.5. Or as <hi>Job</hi> loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his own life, when his ſoul would chuſe ſtrangling and death rather then life, <hi>Job</hi> 7.15, 16. This indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or bitter hatred againſt ſin, is made a fruit, or note of true repentance, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:66159:48"/>Now ſoul, examine the ſoundneſs and ſincerity of thy Repentance hereby. Did the ſighs of thy ſin, ever work in thee a hatred, and abhorrency in thy ſoul againſt ſin? Did it ever make thee to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor thy ſelf in duſt and aſhes? to loath thy ſelf in thine own ſight? An impenitent perſon may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain from ſin, but a true converted, and penitent perſon will hate ſin. An impenitent perſon, may forbare to ſwear; but a true convert, <hi>feareth an oath,</hi> Eccleſ. 9.2. A wicked perſon, may abſtain from ſome groſs evils; but the godly perſon, <hi>will abſtain from all appearance of evil,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.22. A wicked perſon, may leave ſome evil; but the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>and ſuch as love the Lord will hate evil,</hi> Pſal. 97.10. A wicked perſon, may abandon ſome evil way; but the truly repenting perſon, <hi>hateth every falſe way,</hi> Pſal. 119.104. A wicked and an impenitent perſon, may refrain from telling a lye; but the godly and ſuch as are truly converted, <hi>will hate and abhor lying,</hi> verſ. 163. A wicked man, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps check himſelf for his unclean thoughts; but the godly man, <hi>hateth vain thoughts,</hi> verſ. 113. And as <hi>David</hi> in the caſe of a wicked perſon, ſo will the godly ſay upon the account of all and every ſin. <hi>Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee? I hate them with a perfect hatred,</hi> Pſal. 139.21, 22. Now to work this hatred, deteſtation, and averſion in thy will againſt ſin: Take theſe helps.</p>
               <p>Conſider, Firſt, What ſin is in it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Secondly, How God is provoked with it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, How thou art hurt and prejudiced by it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Conſider then, what ſin is in its ſelf.</p>
               <p>Sin in its ſelf is fouler then any Fiend or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:66159:48"/>
in Hell; becauſe, it made that ſo, as fire is hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then water that is heated.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. It is extreamly ill, nothing comes nearer it; for take ſin in the abſtract, ſo its a greater ill then the damnation of a mans ſoul: For when two ills fight together, that which conquers muſt needs be the greater. Now when a man hath lain in Hell ten thouſand years, he is as far from coming out as ever, for the eternal duration in Hell cannot expiate ſin.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. It is moſt infectious, and therefore compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a Leproſie; For the firſt ſin that peeped into the world ſtained the beauty of it. No ſooner was ſin committed by <hi>Adam,</hi> but the Stars ſeemed impure in Gods ſight: the creatures were all at variance, the earth full of Briars and Thorns, and all things ſubjected unto the Curſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4ly. It is moſt filthy, and therefore compared to the moſt vile things that can be named, <hi>To men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruous raggs, To the vomit of Dogs;</hi> and whereas no dirt or filthy thing, can ſtain a Sun-beam; ſin ſtains a more glorious creature, which is the ſoul of man.</p>
               <p n="5">5ly. It is of a helliſh nature, that it draws out, and takes into it ſelf, the wrath of God, being full of curſed conſequences. 1. Privative, the loſs of Gods favour, the blood of Chriſt, the guard of Angels, peace of Conſcience; then which, what can be more obnoxious? 2. Poſitive, It brings all miſery ſpiritual, hardneſs of heart, blindneſs of mind, horrour of conſcience, deſpair, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with all temporal loſſes and croſſes here, and hereafter eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal torments both of ſoul and body, in that lake which burneth with fire and brimſtone forever more, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:66159:49"/>Secondly, Conſider how God is provoked with it.</p>
               <p>For 1. Each ſin is the only object of Gods infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite hatred; what infinite of infinites of hatred haſt thou then upon thy ſoul, with all thy ſins, when each ſin hath the infinite hatred of God upon it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Each ſin is againſt the Majeſty of that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful God of Heaven and Earth, who can turn all things into Hell; nay, Heaven and Hell into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by his word. Now againſt this God thou ſinneſt; and what art thou but duſt and aſhes, a lump of filth, and of uncleanneſs, and all that is naught? And what is thy Life, but a Span, a Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, a Dream, a Shadow of a Dream, and ſhall ſuch a thing offend ſuch a dreadful and glorious Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Every ſin ſtrikes at the glory of Gods pure eye, which cannot look upon iniquity, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.13.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Sin is that which killed his Son, the leaſt ſin could not be pardoned, but by Chriſts carrying his heart blood to his Father, and offering it for ſin.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Each ſin is an offence to all his mercies. This aggravated the ſin upon <hi>Ely,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.29. and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.8, 9. Mercy is the moſt eminent Attribute of God, and therefore the ſin againſt it is the greater. With what aggravations then are our ſins committed in the time of the Goſpel?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Conſider how thou art hurt and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced by it. Each ſin (I mean unrepented of) kills thy ſoul, which is better then all the world. It robs thee of abundance of joy and comfort, and will cauſe thee to walk heavily in the bitterneſs
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:66159:49"/>
and anguiſh of thy ſoul perhaps all thy days; as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did. And how dreadful was that example of <hi>Francis Spira,</hi> who after his back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding lived a while in exquiſite horror, and after died in deſpair? And know, that thine own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will one day accuſe thee for every ſin thou liveſt wilfully in, though now it ſeems hid unto thee, and thy conſcience is more then a thouſand witneſſes. And for the ſins which peradventure thou now liveſt in, and accounteſt but petty and venial, many poor ſouls are at this inſtant burning in hell fire. By all which thou mayſt clearly ſee what miſery and hurt does attend on thee conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually for the ſame: And therefore when any bait of Satan, or old companions would allure thee to ſin, take this <hi>Dilemma;</hi> Either I muſt repent, and then it will bring more ſorrow, then the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or profit did good, or, if I repent not, it will be then the damnation of my ſoul.</p>
               <p>Theſe few things, among many others, may, if ſeriouſly pondered upon, be an effectual means to work thy heart to this hatred and deteſtation of ſin, and a loathing of thy ſelf for the ſame, which as it will evidence the truth of thy repentance, ſo will it be an excellent preſervative againſt the now peſtilential deſtroying Sickneſs. Now when the ſight and ſence of thy ſins hath wrought thy ſoul to a kindly mourning and ſorrowing for the ſame before the Lord, and that for all kinds and ſorts of ſins, to wit,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The weakneſſes, frailties and pollutions of thy nature, even thy proneſs and inclination to ſin; for though theſe being unconſented unto are no actual ſins, yet are they matter of true ſorrow,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:66159:50"/>
grief and humiliation to a ſincere Chriſtian, that he is ſuch a polluted and unclean creature, and ſo apt to fall into all ſin, if he be not reſtrained and prevented by Gods grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the ſinful acts and habits of thy unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate life, with all the aggravations belonging to them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſlips and relapſes of thy moſt rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate life, and the infinite frailties and infirmities that ſtill adhere to it; And that thy ſoul is wrought alſo to a real hatred and deſtation of all ſin, ſo that now thou begineſt to loath ſin, as a thing not onely hurtful, but ugly and abominable; a ſoul and beaſtly thing, and that which is moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, not onely to the pure and unſpotted eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and being of God, but alſo contrary to, and unbefitting the nature and excellency of a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able creature, as man is. I ſay when theſe gracious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of ſoul, of grief and hatred for ſin are wrought in thee, then wilt thou not be aſhamed from a contrite and wounded heart, to make an humble confeſſion and acknowledgement thereof before the face of Almighty God, our heavenly Father, begging pardon and forgiveneſs for them. Then wilt thou own thy ſelf a vile ſinner, who haſt worthily deſerved his wrath; then wilt thou make an ennumeration of the particular ſorts of thy ſins, of which thou knoweſt thy ſelf guilty: Then wilt thou aggravate thoſe ſins upon thy ſelf, by all the circumſtances and heightning acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of them; comprizing all thy unknown and unconfeſt ſins under ſome ſuch penitentiary ſpeech and expreſſion as that of <hi>Davids, Who can tell how oft he offendeth? cleanſe thou me from my ſecret

faults, Pſal.</hi> 19.12. And as thou art to confeſs unto God, and give glory unto him, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7.19. whom thou haſt cheifly and principally offended; ſo art thou commanded alſo to confeſs unto men, <hi>James</hi> 5.16. <hi>Confeſs your faults one to another.</hi> And that for theſe reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That ſo we may be capable of one anothers prayers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe it may be our ſins are ſuch as have injured others, and then confeſſion unto them, is the firſt degree towards reconciliation, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.24. Or if they be onely againſt God, yet the confeſſion of them to the Lords faithful Miniſters and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, will not be improper, but in ſome kind neceſſary to ſuch as deſire the abſolution and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of them, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.15.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe in ſin there is the guilt and the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, the one to be pardoned the other cured. The firſt being confeſt to God to obtain his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, ought alſo, if it have been offenſive and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous to the Congregation, to be acknowledged to them, that, that expreſſion of repentance may make ſatisfaction to them for the ill example, and avert and deter from ſin, whom it had invited to it. And ſurely, the diſcloſing of the particular ſtate of thy ſinful ſick ſoul, and adviſing with others, eſpecially the Phyſicians of the ſoul, how and by what means a cure may be wrought; how a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging ſin may be ſubdued, the occaſions and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations to it avoided, cannot but be very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, comfortable and advantageous, as to the proſperous conſtitution, and health of thy ſoul. The neceſſity of which confeſſion and acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſin will further appear, not onely from
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:66159:51"/>
the practiſe of <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 51.3, 4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32, 5. <hi>Ezra Chap.</hi> 9.6, 7. <hi>Nehemiah Chap.</hi> 9.32. <hi>Job</hi> 40.3. <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.7. <hi>Daniel</hi> 9.4, 5. and other holy men in Scripture; but alſo from ſuch expreſs Texts of Scripture as theſe, <hi>If we confeſs our ſins, God is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all our unrighteouſneſs,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. <hi>I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged my ſin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid: I ſaid, I will confeſs my transgreſſions unto the Lord, and thou forgaveſt the iniquity of my ſin, Pſal.</hi> 32.5. So <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.13. <hi>He that covereth his Sins ſhall not proſper, but who ſo confeſſeth, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaketh them, ſhall have mercy:</hi> And this leads me to the Third particular, as that which will evidence the ſoundneſs and ſincerity of our Repentance.</p>
               <p>Thirdly: If thy Repentance be ſound, there will be a willing forſaking and renunciation of all ſin, an abjuring of all thy former evil ways, both of the ſins themſelves, and the occaſions which were wont to bring thee to thoſe ſins, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.22. For, all thy fear and trembling at the wrath of God to come for ſin, thy ſorrow for ſin, thy hating and loathing of ſin, will not make thy Contrition full and perfect, unleſs thy will alſo do his part, and reſolve to forſake and leave it. For true Contrition or dying unto ſin, is ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction of the heart for the ſame, as is joyned with a purpoſe, will, and reſolution to leave, and forſake it. <hi>The gratious ſoul will hate every falſe way,</hi> Pſal. 119.104. and not tolerate or allow it ſelf, in any known evil or boſome corruption whatſoever, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.23. It will not ſay, as <hi>Lot</hi> ſaid of <hi>Zoar, Is it not a little one?</hi> Gen. 19.20. Or
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:66159:51"/>
as <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian, The Lord pardon thy Servant in this thing, when I bow down my ſelf in the Houſe of</hi> Rimmon, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5.18. It will not account any ſin little, which will bring upon us the great wrath of ſo infinite a Majeſty. It knows and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leives, that the weight even of little ſins, as it were ſmall ſands, will ſinck the ſhip of our ſouls, as well as our greater and groſſer ſins. That ſmall leaks in Ships, and ſmall breeches in Walls being neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will endanger the loſs both of Ships and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: And that ſuch Tradeſmen, as in their accompts regard not ſmall ſums, will quickly prove Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts.</p>
               <p>Diſobedience, though in never ſo ſmall matters, as in eating of an Apple, and gathering a few ſticks on the Sabbath, looking into, and touching of the Ark, are yet in Gods account no ſmall matters: For how ſeverly hath he puniſhed all theſe, then which what can we imagine ſlighter? But gratious ſouls know, that it is not the ſmallneſs of the thing, that leſſens either our obedience or diſobedience, but that it is Gods Commandment, that ties to obedience in leſſer things as well as in greater, which Command of his is deſpiſed, as well in the breach of the leſſer, as of the greater. I ſay then, the truly repenting ſoul, will not allow it ſelf in any known ſin, though accounted never ſo little, ſince the very leaſt are committed againſt ſo great a God, and bring upon us ſo great a danger. It will not excuſe, extenuate, mince, or hide ſin as <hi>Adam,</hi> nor caſt it off himſelf upon others ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.21. But it would willingly be divorced and ſeparated both in ſpirit, conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and affection, from all and every the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:66159:52"/>
and defilements of ſin; which if wilfully and willingly lived in, he knows will expoſe his ſoul to inevitable ruine and deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Conſider then, hath the wrath of God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the everlaſting wo denounced to all impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent ſinners made thee fear and tremble? Have thy tremblings been ſeconded with a true and hearty ſorrow for thy ſins? Hath thy ſorrow been ſuch as hath brought forth hate and loathing of ſin, ſo that ſin hath appeared ugly and abominable unto thee? Hath there then followed an humble confeſſion, and laying open of thy ſins before God? begging pardon and remiſſion of them, with a deſire to be rid of them, and a real purpoſe and reſolution, to abandon them and forſake them? This will evidence, that thy ſervice of ſin hath given up the ghoſt, and that thou haſt a firme reſolution of leading a new life, and returning unto the Lord with all thy heart; which is the fourth and laſt particular to be inſiſted on, in this ſubject of ſound Evangelical repentance. For what is Repentance indeed, in the true definition of it, but a change of the mind, or a coming to a mans ſelf again, to a right underſtanding after a man hath erred; conſiſting, in a turning of the whole heart from Satan and Sin unto God, that is, to ſerve God in newneſs of Life, becauſe he that lives in ſin, ſerves the Devil, and belongs to his juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
               <p>This definition you ſhall find full and whole in our Saviours words to Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> when he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him going to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> Act. 26.18. as <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf reporteth them; namely, <hi>That he would ſend him to the Gentiles, to open their eyes, and to turn
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:66159:52"/>
them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they might receive forgiveneſs of ſins, and inheritance among them that are ſanctified;</hi> Which voice <hi>Paul</hi> thereſaith, he was obedient unto and thereupon went and ſhewed firſt to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and then to the <hi>Gentiles, That they ſhould repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance.</hi> So, that according to the definition, Repentance hath two parts, <hi>An Averſion or turning away from Satan and Sin,</hi> that is the firſt; then a <hi>Converſion or turning unto God by Newneſs of Life,</hi> that is the ſecond part: but I proceed.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The laſt thing that will evidence the ſincerity of that Repentance, which will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent with the Lord, to avert his wrath, and quench the fire of his indignation that is broken out among us, is, a returning unto the Lord with all the heart, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Return thou back-ſliding Iſrael</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>and I will not cauſe mine anger to fall upon you, for I am merciful</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>and I will not keep anger for ever. Onely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge thine iniquity, that thou haſt tranſgreſſed, and repent and turn your ſelves from all your tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>ſo iniquity ſhall not be your ruine,</hi> Ezek. 18.30. In the 2. of <hi>Joel,</hi> the Lord threatning the terribleneſs of his Judgements, in referenece to his great Army, how that the Earth ſhould quake before them, and the Heavens ſhould tremble, the Sun and Moon ſhould be dark, and the Stars ſhould withdraw their ſhining; In the 12. <hi>verſe,</hi> the Lord exhorteth them to a thorough repentance, as the only means to ſtop the currant of this devouring and ſweeping Judgment: <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:66159:53"/>
alſo now</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>turn ye even to me, with all your heart, and with faſting, and with weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and with mourning. And rent your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the Lord your God; for he is gratious and merciful, ſlow to anger, and of great kindneſs, and repenteth him of the evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this Exhortation is urged by divers Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</p>
               <p n="1">1. By promiſe of temporal bleſſings, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, plentiful fruits of the earth, even to the repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all their former loſſes, by the Famine, and removal of the Northren Army from them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. <hi>to</hi> 28.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Of ſpiritual Evangelical priviledges, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of thoſe temporals were but an imperfect pledge, <hi>viz.</hi> plentiful pourings out of his ſpirit, and his gifts upon all fleſh, Gentiles as well as Jews, <hi>ver.</hi> 28, 29. Salvation and deliverance of an elect remnant in his Church, after the Lord hath manifeſted, by dreadful ſigns, the terrour of his coming, <hi>verſ.</hi> 30, 31, 32.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. This Exhortation is urged, by threatning of deſtruction againſt all the oppreſſing enemies of the Church. Theſe are the bleſſed fruits (among others) of that repentance, that is, a returning unto the Lord with all the heart. Suitable to which, is that of the Prophet <hi>Jeremy, If thou wilt return, O Iſrael</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>return unto me, and if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my ſight, then ſhalt thou not remove,</hi> Jer. 4.1. Then ſhalt thou not wander, thou ſhalt not go into exile. Which foregoing places do imply, that God is not pleaſed with ſhews, or flying thoughts, or looſe purpoſes, or half a heart, but requires an
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:66159:53"/>
upright turning away from evil, and a thorough converſion to himſelf, and that which is good, and not to idols, or any other vanities whatſoever. There is a ſpecial place to this purpoſe, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.29, 30. It ſpeaks of the Lords ſcattering of them among the Nations, and how they ſhould be leſt few in number among the Heathen, whither the Lord ſhould lead them; <hi>But if from thence</hi> (ſaith the Lord, by his ſervant <hi>Moſes) thou ſhalt ſeek the Lord thy God, thou ſhalt find him, if thou ſeek him with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul. When thou art in tribulation, and all theſe things are come upon thee, even in the latter days, if thou turn unto the Lord thy God, and ſhalt be obedient unto his voice.</hi> For the neglect whereof, ſee what a bitter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint the Lord took up againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Amos 4.6. <hi>How he had given them cleanneſs of teeth, and want of bread in all places, and had ſent among them the Peſtilence after the manner of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown ſome of them, as he overthrew</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah, <hi>and they were as a fire-brand pluckt out of the burning, yet did they not return unto the Lord.</hi> But mark what follows? <hi>Therefore, thus will I do unto thee O Iſrael, and becauſe I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Iſrael.</hi> And what did he threaten he would do unto them, for their obſtinacy and incorrigableneſs if they repented not? The 2. <hi>verſe</hi> declares it. <hi>The Lord God hath ſworn by his holineſs, that lo, the days ſhall come upon you, that he will take you away with hooks and your poſterity with fiſh-hooks.</hi> Whats the meaning of that? underſtand, that like as great fiſhes are pull'd and drawn up out of the Sea with hooks, ſo he would cauſe them to be pulled out of their Land by the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:66159:54"/>
enemy, how loath and unwilling ſoever they were to quit it. To prevent which, the Lord exhorts them that they would prepare to meet him with true converſion, as a ſpecial means to appeaſe his wrath, and prevent their ruine. When <hi>Ephrahim</hi> was turned, and had repented, how was the heart of the Lord taken with it? <hi>Jer.</hi> 31 18, 19, 20. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.8, 9. O then what ſhall I ſay; what arguments ſhall I make uſe of to excite thee, O <hi>England,</hi> to a ſpeedy return unto the Lord? ſurely, thou haſt had many gracious invitations in the day of thy proſperity and peace; but thou wouldſt not hearken thereunto: Many premonitions and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warnings of this day that is now come upon thee by the mouthes of the Lords faithful Meſſengers and Servants.</p>
               <p>And upon this account may it not be ſaid of thee as is recorded and declared concerning the Lords merciful dealings with his own people, and City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where he had placed his name and worſhip, notwithſtanding their great and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold provocations; <hi>Yet the Lord God of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſent to them by his Meſſengers, riſing up betimes and ſending, becauſe he had compaſſion on his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and on his dwelling place. But</hi> (now how did they requite the Lord for all his kindneſs and long ſufferance towards them?) <hi>they mocked the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of God, and deſpiſed his words, and miſuſed his Prophets, until the wrath of the Lord aroſe againſt his people, till there was no remedy,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.15, 16. no healing, no help, their ſores were ſo putrified and feſtred, that they grew incurable. As the Lord by his Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> complained, chap. 1. verſe 4, 6. <hi>The whole head became ſick, and the whole
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:66159:54"/>
heart faint: From the ſole of the foot even unto the head</hi> (from the loweſt to the higheſt, from the Beggar upon the dunghil, to the King upon the throne) <hi>there was no ſoundneſs in it, but wounds, and bruiſes, and putrifying ſores, which could not be bound up, nor mollified with ointment.</hi> The whole body of the State and Nation was ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally corrupted and depraved, that the Lord calls them, <hi>A ſinful Nation, a people laden with iniquity, a ſeed of evil doers, children that were cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupters, and ſuch as had forſaken the Lord, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the holy one of Iſrael unto anger, and had gone backward.</hi> And tells them further, that the was even weary with ſmiting and puniſhing of them; <hi>Why ſhould ye be ſtricken any more? ye will revolt more and more:</hi> Yet ſee for all their great and greivous provoking ſins, and that general depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and corruption that was among all ſorts, from the higheſt to the loweſt of them, as the 21, 22, and 23 verſes of that Chapter do clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the truth of it; How does the Lord notwithſtanding invite them again to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, by gracious promiſes of pardon, and the beſtowing of all good things upon them? <hi>Waſh ye, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well, ſeek judgement, releive the oppreſſed, judge the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, plead for the widow;</hi> intimating wherein they ſhould manifeſt the ſincerity of their repentance, and returning unto the Lord: And then mark what follows; <hi>Come now let us reaſon together (ſaith the Lord) though your ſins be as ſcarlet, they ſhall be as white as ſnow; though they be like crimſon, they ſhall be as wool. If ye be willing and obedient, ye ſhall
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:66159:55"/>
eat the good of the land: But if ye refuſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, ye ſhall be devoured with the ſword.</hi> O the great indulgence and forbearance of the Lord towards this ſo generally depraved, corrupted and unreformed a people! Which is further notably ſet forth in that of the third of <hi>Zephany; Wo to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppreſſing City, ſhe obeyed not the voyce: ſhe received not correction, ſhe truſted not in the Lord: She drew not near to her God. Her Princes within are roaring lions, her Judges are evening wolves, they gnaw not the bones till the morrow. Her Prophets are light and treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous perſons: Her Prieſts have polluted the ſanctuary, they have done violence to the law.</hi> And what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows? <hi>I have cut off the Nations, their towers are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate, I made their ſtreets waſte that none paſſeth by, their Cities are deſtroyed, ſo that there is no man, that there is no inhabitant. I ſaid, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive inſtruction;</hi> (thou wilt now be warned by my judgements upon the Nations round about thee) <hi>ſo their dwelling ſhould not be cut off, howſoever I puniſhed them, but they roſe early, and corrupted all their doings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The filthy leproſie and contagion of ſin had ſo overſpread and infeſted the whole Nation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhe became now ripe for deſtruction. And therefore did the Lord wound her with the wound of an enemy, &amp; with the chaſtiſement of a cruel one, for the multitude of her iniquity, becauſe her ſins were increaſed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.14. And now the wrath of the Lord breaks out, and it could not he appeaſed; For <hi>he brought upon them the King of the</hi> Chaldees, <hi>who ſlew their youngmen with the ſword in the houſe of their ſanctuary, and had no compaſſion upon young
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:66159:55"/>
man or maiden, old man or him that ſtooped for age; he gave them all into his hand,</hi> 2 Chron. 36.16, 17. They would not take example by the judgements of God which he executed upon the heathen round about them, and now God will make them the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of his fierce indignation and wrath: <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tientia loeſa fit furor.</hi> His abuſed and worn out patience is now turned into implacable anger; His Spirit will not always ſtrive, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had her day, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.42. God would have gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, but ſhe would not, and now her houſe is left unto her deſolate, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.37, 38.</p>
               <p>Wilt thou then, O <hi>England,</hi> take a view of thy ſins: and ſee whether they do not equal, if not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verpaſs the ſins of that Nation? Are not thy ſins grown epidemical, and ſpread through the whole body? may it not be ſaid of thee as of that Nation, that the whole Head is ſick, and the whole Heart faint? Can the Throne plead an exemption from this univerſal contagion? Can the Prince or Peaſant, the Nobility or Gentry, the Laick or Eccleſiaſtick? Have not all ſorts and degrees of men and women deeply corrupted themſelves, and turned aſide from following the Lord? When did ſin and tranſgreſſion more abound then in this our age and generation? when did it walk up and down with a more impudent and braſen face? when did you ever ſee Pride to be prouder? Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion more oppreſſive? Adultery more adulterous? Luxury more luxurious? Cruelty more cruel? Unrighteouſneſs more unrighteous, and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of diſobedience to God and his commands, more diſobedient? When was Drunkeneſs and Prodigality, Swearing, Curſing and Blaſpheming,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:66159:56"/>
Ranting and Roaring, Atheiſm and Epicuriſm, more abounding? When was there a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation of Gods holy things? a greater pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Sanctuary? more violence done to his law? a greater contempt of Godlineſs, under the form and outward appearance of it? when was their more ſcoffing at Holineſs, and deriding the Spirit of God, and a more open oppoſition of the pure way and Worſhip of God, then now in our days? And was there ever a greater Apoſtacy and falling away from the Faith, even by ſuch, who once did ſhine as ſtars in the firmament of the Churches Heaven, making ſhipwrack of faith and a good conſcience, to preſerve a little airy honour, and a temporary periſhing eſtate? And how hath the treacherous dealers dealt treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly? and the Brother betrayed and delivered up the brother to death, the Fathers the Children, and the children riſen up againſt their Parents, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them to be put to death? according as was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by our dear Lord, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.21. And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we may take up the ſame doleful lamentation and complaint, with the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> namely, <hi>That truth is fallen in our ſtreets, and equity cannot enter, yea truth faileth, and he that departeth from evil maketh himſelf a prey,</hi> Iſa. 59.14, 15. Yea, hath not wickedneſs been eſtabliſhed by a law? and will not that woe be the portion of ſome who have decreed unrighteous decrees, and write grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſneſs which they have preſcribed; <hi>To turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the needy from judgement, and to take away the right from the poor of Gods people, that widows may be their prey, and that they may rob the fatherleſs?</hi> Iſa. 10.1, 2.</p>

                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:66159:56"/>And what ſhall I ſay to the generality of the late profeſſing people of this generation, when Religion was in faſhion, and the ready way and ſtep to preferment? was it not made even a ſtalking Horſe, by many to obtain their baſe ſiniſter, moſt vile and unworthy ends? How furiouſly did many drive on <hi>Jehu</hi>-like, under the moſt ſpecious and plauſible pretences of piety, and doing great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits for God; <hi>Come ſee my zeal for the Lord,</hi> breaking down the Images, and deſtroying the Worſhippers of <hi>Baal,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 9.20. <hi>and</hi> 10.16, 19, 26.

               <p>O the breakings and rendings, the ſeparatings and dividings that ſprang up from theſe roots of bitterneſs, whereby many ſincere ſouls were trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and others thereby became greatly defiled. Surely, upon a ſerious and ſad reflection hereon, it may be ſaid as concerning the Diviſions of <hi>Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben, Judg.</hi> 5.15. that for theſe things <hi>there were great thoughts of heart,</hi> great impreſſions upon the ſpirits of many that did truly and ſincerely fear the Lord. Nay, what ſhall we ſay to thoſe furious, blind, zealous, phariſaical ſpirits of thoſe times, who did breath out threatnings, perſecutions and ſlaughters even againſt the Diſciples and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Lord, becauſe they could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcienciouſly (and not factiouſly, as they termed it) conform to a publick Directory for worſhip, or ſubmit to ſome unwarrantable and unſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral impoſitions and injunctions, whereby many were caſt into Priſons, their goods violently taken away, and themſelves and families expoſed to great miſery, neceſſity and want? So little did appear, and (much to be lamented it is) ſo little does ſtill appear <hi>of that wiſdom that is from above, that is pure and peaceable, and gentle and eaſie to be entreated,</hi> Jam. 3.17.

How violently do moſt men ſeek to advance, and ſet up their own opinion ſtill? What a Babel, and confuſion of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages are there ſtill among us?

Whereas <hi>Religio docenda, non coercenda,</hi> Religion is to be taught, and not to be forcedly thruſt and impoſed upon the Conſcience. When the Scripture tells us, that <hi>fervent Charity ſhould cover a multitude of ſins,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.8. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſs, it is not large and long enough, to cover one ſin or ſlip, or perhaps but an infirmity, or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in a Brother.

And moſt diſagreeable to the pattern and example of that bleſſed Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, and other the faithful Miniſters of Chriſt, who in his Epiſtle to the Church of <hi>Corinths,</hi> declareth, <hi>That thee had not a dominion over their faith, but were helpers of their joy,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. <hi>And that the weapons of their warfare were not carnal, but mighty through God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. The weapons which they uſed, by the Goſpel of Chriſt to convert men, and to bring them under the Kingdome and obedience of Chriſt, were not carnal, that is, ſuch as natural, and worldly men are wont to make uſe of; either by eloquence or deceit, or by force to bring others in ſubjection under them; but mighty or powerful through God, in moving and convincing of the hearts of men by his Spirit, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.14. Surely, if theſe things were ſeriouſly laid to heart, we muſt needs acknowledge that the ſins of profeſſing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as well as others, have been highly provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto the Lord, as to the drawing down of this ſore viſitation of the Plague among us.</p>
               <p>And this may put us to ſilence, that we murmur not, and will juſtifie the righteouſneſs of God in the way of his ſeverity, as he now comes forth againſt many of his own people. <hi>For we have all ſinned, and come ſhort of the glory of God,</hi> Rom. 3.23. And what ſays the Lord by the Prophet, <hi>Amos. All the ſinners of my people ſhall dye by the ſword,

which ſay, The evil ſhall not overtake nor prevent us, Amos</hi> 9.10. So the Lord by the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> complains: <hi>For among my people are found wicked men: they lay waite, as he that ſetteth ſnares, they ſet a trap, they catch men. As a Cage is full of birds, ſo are their houſes full of deceit: therefore they are become great, and waxen rich. They are waxen fat, they ſhine, they overpaſs the deeds of the wicked, they judge not the cauſe, the cauſe of the fatherleſs: yet they proſper: and the right of the needy do they not judge.</hi> And mark what follows? <hi>Shall I not viſit for theſe things, ſaith the Lord? ſhall not my ſoul be avenged on ſuch a Nation as this,</hi> Jer. 25.26, 27, 28, 29. <hi>And who gave</hi> Jacob <hi>for a ſpoil, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>to the robbers? Did not the Lord, he againſt whom we have ſinned? for they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient unto his law.</hi> And conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der well what follows. <hi>Therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the ſtrength of battle, and it hath ſet him on fire round about, yet he knew not, and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart,</hi> Jſa. 42.24, 25. So <hi>Jeremy</hi> the 12.7. <hi>I have forſaken mine houſe, I have left mine heritage, I have given the dearly beloved of my ſoul into the hands of her enemies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what may we gather from all this? Surely thus much, That no near relations as to God, or any external priviledges, can yeild a protection, from a ſin-deſerved correction. Remember <hi>Lots</hi> wife, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.32.

Lords Table, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29, 30. God is of purer eyes then to behold iniquity, with any approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or tolleration as to his own peculiar people. <hi>If his children forſake my law</hi> (ſpeaking of <hi>David</hi> and his ſeed, as a Type of Chriſt and the true ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſeed) <hi>and walk not in my judgments: If they break my Statutes, and keep not my Commandments:</hi> What then ſays the Lord? <hi>Then will I viſit their tranſgreſſion with a rod, and their iniquity with ſtripes,</hi> Pſal. 89.30. The Lord hath laid righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the rule, and waighed his juſtice in a bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance; and his judgments are right, and in faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he doth afflict, Pſal. 119.75. His ſentence is paſt forth, and ſtands irrevocable: <hi>Tribulation and anguiſh upon every ſoul that doth evil,</hi> Rom. 2.9. If we ſin we ſhall ſuffer. How? <hi>Aut a Deo vindicante, aut ab ipſo homine penitente,</hi> as one ſays excellent well; Either from God revenging, or themſelves repenting. For he that repenteth himſelf of his ſins, doth puniſh himſelf for his ſins.</p>
               <p>And now, O <hi>England,</hi> if thou repent not, let me ſay unto thee, as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> Chap. 10.2. to the men of that generation. What wilt thou do now in the day of thy viſitation, and in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation that ſhall come from far. To whom wilt thou flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory? O then bethink thy ſelf yet, before it be too late, before the wrath of the Lord break out, ſo that their will be no remedy. O gather thy ſelf together, O Nation not deſirous, before the Decree bring forth, before the fierce anger of the Lord come upon thee, before the whole Land be devoured by the fire of his jealouſie, before he make a ſpeedy riddance of all that dwell in the land.

               <p>This is the way the Lord himſelf propounds for the removal of his ſweeping devouring Judgments, <hi>Turn ye, even to me with all your heart, and with faſting, and with weeping, and with mourning, and rent your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the Lord your God, who knoweth if he will return, and repent, and leave a bleſſing behind him,</hi> Joel 2.12, 13.

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:66159:61"/>
all; <hi>Above all, taking the ſheild of faith, wherewith ye ſhall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.</hi> Some tranſlate it <hi>(in all)</hi> as if he had ſaid, in all things whatſoever you do, ſee that you uſe the ſheild of faith; <hi>(to all)</hi> as if he had ſaid, to all other Graces add this; <hi>(above all)</hi> which is more emphatical, for hereby all the imperfections of the reſt of the Armes are covered, and we are beſt defended againſt all the fiery darts, and aſſaults of Satan, that is, his poyſonous darts: which by their venome inflame the ſoul. The Apoſtle alludes to the cuſtome of old, in times of war, who by their darts ſhot fire; or elſe, when they dipped the heads of their arrows in poiſon, and ſhot them at their enemies, they even fired their fleſh: To prevent which, it is ſaid, that the Souldiers made them large ſheilds of raw Neatſ-leather, which might cover the whole body, ſo that when the fiery venemous darts lighted upon them, they were preſently quenched. All which agrees well with the nature of Satans temptations, which as poiſon and fire, do wound and pierce the ſoul, if they be not ſtopped and quenched by the ſheild of faith, when they hit upon it.</p>
               <p>So in the 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. The Apoſtle directs to the making uſe of this moſt excellent peice of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians armour of proof, ſpeaking of our adverſary the Devil, who as a roaring Lion walketh about, ſeeking whom he may devour; This counſel he gives, <hi>That we reſiſt him ſtedfaſtly in the faith.

flee from thee, he will run away; if thou with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him, oppoſe him, and ſet thy ſelf, as it were, in battle array againſt him; thou wilt find him as very a coward, as ever any that handled a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon; thou wilt make him run away preſently.</p>
               <p>But that you may reſiſt him and foil him, you muſt be ſure to reſiſt him, and that ſtedfaſtly in the faith; if you make uſe of this weapon, he will never be able to encounter with you: Faith will foil him. By this weapon, the Saints always overcame him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.11. <hi>And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb.</hi> And how by the blood of the Lamb? Satan will tell thee, thou art a vile, filthy, polluted, and abominable wretch; a great and hainous ſinner: but faith in the blood of Chriſt will tell him, that Chriſt Jeſus came into the world to ſave ſinners; yea, the greateſt and cheifeſt of ſinners, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. <hi>And that God hath ſet him forth to be a Propitiation through faith in his blood for the remiſſion of ſins,</hi> Rom. 3.25.

               <p>Satan will tell thee, thou haſt broken the Law, and incurred Gods anger, wrath, hell, and eternal damnation: Faith will tell him, that Chriſt hath perfectly fulfilled the Law, ſatisfied divine juſtice; taken away the curſe, and freed thee from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. and that Jeſus Chriſt by his blood hath pacified Gods anger towards thee, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25.

               <p>Does he tempt thee to be a ſervant of men? tell him thou art bought with a price, and ſo freed from that ſervitude, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.23. would he have thee to pleaſe men? tell him, if yet thou ſhouldſt

pleaſe men, thou ſhouldſt not be the ſervant of Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.10. Does he tempt thee to the love of the world? tell him, that if <hi>any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.15. Does he tempt thee to an indifferent, luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm ſpirit in the things of God? tell him, that the Lord teſtifies againſt ſuch a ſpirit, that is neither hot nor cold, that he will ſpue it out of his mouth, <hi>Rev</hi> 3.16.

power of ſin? This faith will aſſure thee, That ſin ſhall not have dominion over thee, for that thou art not under the law, but under grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. Doſt thou yet fear that thy ſins ſhall ſtand on the file, and that God will remember thine iniquity? this faith in Chriſts blood will aſſure thee, that he will blot out thy tranſgreſſions for his own name ſake, and will not remember thy ſins, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.25.</p>
               <p>But perhaps thou art afraid of Death, and of the power of the Grave; this Faith will aſſure thee, that <hi>death is ſwallowed up in victory,</hi> his ſting taken out, that Chriſt hath ranſomed thee from the power of the grave, and hath redeemed thee from death, that he is deaths plague, and the graves deſtruction, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.8. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.54. So that we may triumphantly ſay, <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? it is God that juſtifieth.

Wilt thou not then fear this ſevere ſtroke of Gods viſitation. O get more of the blood of ſprinkling on thy ſoul, this ſpeaketh better things then the blood of <hi>Abet.</hi> The blood of the Paſchal Lamb was to be ſtrook

on the two ſide poſts, and on the upper door poſt of the houſes of the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when God did intend to ſmite the firſt-born in the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and execute his judgement againſt all the Egyptian gods, and ſaith the Lord, <hi>When I ſee the the blood I will paſs over you,</hi> meaning the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael, <hi>and the Plague ſholl not be upon you to deſtroy you, when I ſmite the Land of Egypt.</hi> What did this typifie and hold forth, but Chriſt the true Paſſover or Paſchal Lamb, whoſe blood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſprinkling the conſcience, cleanſeth us from all ſin, and delivereth us from the ſtroke of the deſtroying Angel, even from wrath to come, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.10.</p>
               <p>See then that thou exerciſe thy ſelf continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in that onely heaven upon earth, and ſweeteſt ſanctuary to a hunted, troubled ond afflicted ſoul, <hi>The life of Faith,</hi> in reference to thy <hi>Salvation, Sanctification and Preſervation.</hi> As to thy <hi>Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> Let the truly-humbled ſoul, grieved and grao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning under the heavy weight and burden of ſin, throw itſelf into the meritorious and merciful arms of Jeſus Chriſt, wounded, broken and bleeding upon the Croſs, and there let it hold and hide it ſelf for ever, in full aſſurance of eternal life, by vertue of that promiſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.36. <hi>He that beleiveth on the Son hath everlaſting life.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. As to thy <hi>Sanctification;</hi> If thou keep thy <hi>Faith,</hi> the fountain, root and heart, as it were, from which all thine other Graces ſpring, in life and vigour, thou wilt pray more comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, be more couragiouſly patient, hear the Word more faithfully, receive Chriſts Ordinance of Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king bread more joyfully, ſpend the Lords day more

delightfully, confer more chearfully, meditate more heavenly, and walk in all the ways of new obedience, with more ſtrength and conqueſt over corruptions.

               <p n="3">3.

               <p>Secondly, Act Faith in the power, ability all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency, and omnipotency of God.

The conſideration of whoſe mighty power, made the Pſalmiſt thus to break forth; <hi>O Lord God of Hoſts, who is a ſtrong Lord, like unto thee, or to thy faithfulneſs round about thee? Thou ruleſt the raging of the Sea, when the waves thereof ariſe, thou ſtilleſt them; thou haſt broken Rahab in peices as one that

               <p>Beware then how we call into queſtion the power and all-ſufficiency of God; How we ſpeak againſt God; This was the ſin of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and it was highly provoking unto the Lord. Its ſaid they ſpake againſt God and ſaid, <hi>Can God furniſh a Table in the Wilderneſs? Behold he ſmote the rock, that the waters guſhed out, and the ſtreams overflowed, can he give bread alſo? can he provide fleſh for his people? therefore the Lord heard this, and was wrath,</hi> Pſa. 88.19, 20, 21. <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo, he falls expoſtulating the caſe with God. <hi>The people amongſt whom I am</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand footmen, and thou haſt ſaid, I will give, them fleſh, that they may eat a whole moneth; Shall the Flocks and the Heards be ſlain for them, to ſuffice them? or ſhall all the Fiſh of the Sea be gathered together for them, to ſuffice them?</hi> And what Argument does the Lord uſe to convince <hi>Moſes</hi> of his carnal, if not incredulous reaſonings, But this, <hi>Is the Lords hand waxed ſhort?</hi> thou ſhalt ſee now whether my word ſhall come to paſs unto thee or not, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.21, 22, 23. <hi>And the Lord rained fleſh upon them as duſt, and feathered Fowles like as the ſand of the Sea,</hi> though it was given as a great judgement unto them, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 88.27. The ſame Argument does the Lord make uſe of, when he falls a reaſoning with his people the Jews, upon the account of their dereliction or

rejection, and that they might yet have ſound ground of hope ſtill of their reſtauration, though they had ſold themſelves for their iniquities, and could not produce any Bill of Divorcement of the Lords putting of them away, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.2. <hi>Is my hand ſhortned at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? Behold, at my rebuke I dry up the Sea: I make the Rivers a Wilderneſs; their Fiſh ſtincketh becauſe there is no water, and dieth for thirſt. I cloath the Heavens with blackneſs, and I make ſack-cloth their covering:</hi> So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.1. <hi>Behold the Lords hand is not ſhortned, that it cannot ſave, neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear;</hi> Which may be an excellent ſupport to our faith. Let thy Faith then be exerciſed in the mighty power of God, in theſe following particular caſes and ſeaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In times of great difficulties and ſtreights.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In times of ſore ſickneſſes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In times of great ſinning.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In times of Worſhipping and Serving the Lord.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In times of great ſuffering for the Lord.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In times of great difficulties and ſtreights; Know that the ſame Almighty power, who could ſmite the Rock, and cauſe the waters to guſh out, and the ſtreams to overflow, can furniſh a table in the Wilderneſs, can give bread, and provide fleſh for his people. Take heed now of ſuch irrational, abſurd, and prepoſterous reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings; The Lord ſmote the Rock, and gave water in abundance, but can he now furniſh a table in the Wilderneſs? I remember the time when I was in great ſtreights, for bodily and ſoul
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:66159:66"/>
refreſhments; and the Lord ſmote the Rock in a ſtrange, miraculous, and unexpected way, and the Waters guſhed out, and the ſtreams over-flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; I had comfortable ſupplies for ſoul and body, and that in a plentiful manner. But can he now help me in my ſtreights, and ſupply my neceſſities? now all conduit pipes are cut off, and all viſible means of ſupplies and ſupports are taken away, Taxes are multiplied and increaſed, our Trade is gone, the Gentry gone, and ſuch as gave life and being thereunto, have laid aſide, and betook themſelves to a retired life; many gone beyond the Seas, becauſe they could not follow their callings, and be ſuffered to enjoy the freedom of their conſciences too; God hath ſmitten ſome of my dear friends or relations, who were inſtruments in his hand of my comfortable ſuſtentation and ſupportation, and now, my Wife, and Children, begin to ſtare me in the face, to ſob and ſigh, and I have not wherewith to releive them; The ſight and thoughts of theſe things do even break my heart, and wound my very bowels within me; what ſhall I do? what courſe ſhall I take for a livelihood? Methinks I hear ſuch doleful complaints among thouſands deſtreſſed Families in the City at this time. Is it not a time and ſeaſon then to be acting faith in the mighty power and providence of God? Surely it is an eaſie matter to truſt God, when we have Meal in the Barrel, and Oyl in the Cruſe, and Money in our Purſe; but wilt thou truſt God, and rely upon his power, in the want and abſence of all; As the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> when the Fig-tree did not bloſſom, nor fruit could
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:66159:66"/>
be found in the Vines, when the labour of the Olive did fail, and the Field did yeild no meat, when the Flocks were cut off from the fold, and there were no Herd in the ſtall, when there was an utter conſumption and deprivation of all things; then to be rejoycing in the Lord, and joying in the God of our ſalvation. Then to ſay, the Lord is my ſtrength, and he will make me to walk on my high places. Then to ſay, the Lord is my ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, I ſhall not want; as <hi>David,</hi> and though I walk through the valley of the ſhadow of death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me, thy rod and thy ſtaff they comfort me, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. then to live beleivingly, truſtingly, and dependingly upon God.</p>
               <p>This is a high Act of Faith in the Power of God. And O that I could miniſter a word of ſupport unto thy ſoul in ſuch a condition: Well, be not faithleſs, but beleiving; live ſtill in the faith of the all-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of God: That his hand is not ſhortned, that it cannot help; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear; there's no diminution of his power, or is there any unwillingneſs in God to hear and help in a time of need: <hi>Wherefore ſhould I fear in the days of evil</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>when the iniquity of my heels ſhall compaſs me about,</hi> Pſal. 49.5.</p>
               <p>So ſay thou, thou poor, doubting, and diſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoul. Why ſhould I fear in this evil day? why ſhould I diſtruſt that God, and doubt of his power and all-ſufficiency to help me now, who hath fed me, and cloathed me, and ſuſtained me all the days of my life? Why ſhould I not be caſting my care upon him, who hath not only promiſed,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:66159:67"/>
but is able alſo to take care of me? 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.7. Why do I not caſt my burden upon the Lord, who hath graciouſly promiſed (and he is able alſo) <hi>to ſuſtain me, and will never ſuffer the righteous to be moved?</hi> Pſal. 55.22. This was a great ſtay and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, when God promiſed to make him a Father of may Nations; He conſidered not the deadneſs of his own body, being about 100. years old, nor the deadneſs of <hi>Sarai's</hi> womb. He ſtaggered not at the promiſe of God through unbeleif, but was ſtrong in faith giving glory to God; and being fully perſwaded, that what he had promiſed, he was able alſo to perform. Mark I pray you, he did not only beleive the promiſe, but the ability of God alſo, he fixt his faith in the power and all-ſufficiency of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.19, 20, 21. He was aſſured, that God was as able, as he was faithful in the performance of his promiſe. God had ſaid unto him, but a little before, <hi>Abram, I am the Almighty God, walk before me, and be thou perfect;</hi> and now <hi>Abram</hi> would not queſtion it in the leaſt, he knew his grace was all-ſufficient for him, and that his ſtrength could be perfected in his weakneſs.</p>
               <p>As the Lord told <hi>Paul</hi> in another caſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. And has left it for ever upon record, as a moſt precious cordial of comfort, to refreſh and ſupport the moſt fainty, diſtreſſed, and diſconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late ſoul: To wit, <hi>When the poor and needy ſeek water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirſt, I the Lord will hear them, I the God of Iſrael will not forſake them;</hi> And that they may not think he wants power to perform what he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed (ſaith he) <hi>I will open rivers in high places,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:66159:67"/>
and fountains in the midſt of the values: I will make the wilderneſs a pool of water, and the dry land ſprings of water,</hi> Iſa. 41.17, 18, 19.</p>
               <p>Surely, this promiſe is very applicable to poor, needy, thirſty, hungry ſouls, upon the accompt of temporal or ſpiritual refreſhment. And the Saints have beleived it: <hi>Though I walk</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) in the midſt of trouble, thou wilt revive me, thou wilt ſtretch forth thine hand againſt the wrath of mine enemies, and thy right hand ſhall ſave me,</hi> Pſal. 138.7. <hi>Yea, though I walk through the valley of the ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death,</hi> (though I ſhould be in the moſt dark, diſmal and uncomfortable condition) <hi>yet I will fear no evil, thou art with me, thy preſence ſhall ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port me, thy rod, and thy ſtaffe, they ſhall comfort me,</hi> Pſal. 23.4. <hi>Though he ſlay me</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job) yet will I truſt in him: I will maintain mine own ways be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. He alſo ſhall be my ſalvation,</hi> Job. 13.15.</p>
               <p>So when the enemies of God are high, and the Church of Chriſt very low. O this acting of faith in the power of God is of great uſe. <hi>O God, how long ſhall the adverſary reproach, ſhall the enemy blaſpheme thy name for ever? Why withdraweſt thou thy hand, even thy right hand</hi> (and thats the hand of power and ſtrength ſurely) <hi>pluck it out of thy boſome. For God is my King of old</hi> (conſider it I pray you) <hi>working ſalvation in the midſt of the earth. Thou didſt divide the Sea by thy ſtrength: thou breakeſt the heads of the Dragons in the waters. Thou brakeſt the heads of Leviathan in peices, and gaveſt him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs. Thou didſt clean the fountain and the floud: thou driedſt up mighty rivers,</hi> Pſal. 74.10, 11, 12,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:66159:68"/>
13, 14, 15. What cannot the Lord do, when he hath a purpoſe to ſave his people, and to deſtroy his enemies? <hi>Thy way, O God, is in the ſanctuary: who is ſo great a god as our God? Thou art the God that doſt wonders: thou haſt declared thy ſtrength among the people. Thou haſt with thine own redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thy people, the Sons of</hi> Jacob <hi>and</hi> Joſeph, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.13, 14, 15. <hi>Wilt thou not revive us again, that thy people may rejoyce in thee,</hi> Pſal. 85.6. This raiſed up the Churches hopes, in the ſtormy and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous times of perſecution; and why? <hi>The Lord reigneth, he is cloathed with majeſty, the Lord is cloathed with ſtrength, wherewith he hath girded himſelf,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The flouds have lifted up, O Lord, the flouds have lifted up their voice: the flouds lift up their waves.</hi> What then? <hi>The Lord on high is mightier then the noiſe of many waters; yea, then the mighty waves of the Sea.</hi> And ſo ſaid <hi>Jethro,</hi> when <hi>Moſes</hi> had told him what the Lord had done unto <hi>Pharoah,</hi> and to the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> for <hi>Iſraels</hi> ſake, and all the travel that had come upon them by the way, and how the Lord delivered them. <hi>Now I know</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that the Lord is greater then all gods:</hi> for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly, he was above them.</p>
               <p>This is the Churches comfort, that though their enemies are high, and proud, and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, yet the Lord is above them, <hi>Ezod.</hi> 18.8, 11. This was the Argument that good King <hi>Jehoſophat</hi> uſed in prayer with the Lord, when a great multitude of enemies came againſt him. <hi>O Lord God of our fathers, art not thou God in heaven? and ruleſt not thou over all the Kingdomes of the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:66159:68"/>
Heathen; and in thine hand is there not power and might, ſo that none is able to withſtand thee? Art not thou our God, who didſt drive out the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of this land before thy people Iſrael, and gaveſt it to the ſeed of</hi> Abraham <hi>thy freind for ever? O our God, wilt not thou judge them? for we have no might againſt this great company that cometh againſt us: neither know we what to do, but our eyes are upon thee.</hi> And the Lord did thereupon ſhew forth his mighty power, and that this great multitude was not able to withſtand him. For he ſet am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſhments againſt the Children of <hi>Ammon, Moab,</hi> and <hi>Mount Seir,</hi> that came againſt <hi>Judah,</hi> and they were ſmitten, and every one afterwards helped to deſtroy another, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.</p>
               <p>O then be acting faith, in this great and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful <hi>Jehovah,</hi> that he would make bare his holy arm, in the eyes of all the Nations; that all the ends of the earth, may ſee the ſalvation of our God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.10. Fear and tremble before him, whoſe mighty power hath limited, and bounded the proud and imperious waves of the Sea; that hitherto ſhall they come and no further, and here ſhall its proud waves be ſtayed, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 5.22. comp. with <hi>Job</hi> 37.11. Fear him, that can caſt both body and ſoul into hell, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.28. It is he that makes the pillars of heaven to tremble, and to be aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at his reproof, <hi>Job</hi> 26.11.</p>
               <p>And learn to depend on this Almighty being for preſervation in all ſtreights and exigents whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, who can preſerve without means, as <hi>Elijah,</hi> forty days and forty nights, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.8. by ſtrange and miraculous means, even by the help

And that his power, and his wrath is againſt all them that do evil, <hi>Ezra</hi> 8.22. And let it be matter of conſolation and encouragement in our prayers, that we call on that God, who is able to do exceedingly abundantly, above all that we ask or think, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.20. In our perſeverance; That the everlaſting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth who fainteth not, neither is weary, will renew our ſtrength, that we ſhall run and not be, weary, and walk, and not faint, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.31.

vile bodies ſhall be chaanged and faſhioned like unto his glorious body</hi> (even by the mighty and abſolute power of Chriſt) <hi>according to the working where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is able even to ſubdue all things unto himſelf,</hi> Phil. 3.21. All created powers being derived from him, and ſubordinate unto him, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.12. and 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14.11.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Act faith in the mighty power of God, and that in times of ſickneſs, and of this ſore viſitation of the Lord. Know that this is the Lords prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative royal, to kill and to make alive, to bring down to the grave and to bring up again, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.6. This the Lord challengeth, as his own ſovereign, peculiar right, <hi>I, even I, am he, and there is no God with me; I kill and I make alive, I wound and I heal; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any that can deliver out of my hand,</hi> Deut. 32.39. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.1, 2, 3 Saith the Church there, <hi>Lord thou haſt bin our dwelling place in all genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Before the mountains were brought forth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>even from everlaſting to everlaſting, thou art God.</hi> And what follows? <hi>Thou turneſt man to deſtruction, and ſayſt, Return ye children of men.</hi> The conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of this mighty power and the Churches acting faith in the ſame, did put her upon pious thoughts of returning unto the Lord; <hi>Come, and let us return unto the Lord, for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath ſmitten, and he will bind us up.</hi> And what follows? <hi>After two days will he revive us, in the third day he will raiſe us up, and we ſhall live in his ſight,</hi> Hoſ. 6.1, 2.</p>
               <p>Conſider then in the firſt place, whoever thou art, that art thus under the chaſtiſing hand of God, that affliction commeth not forth of the duſt, neither doth trouble ſpring out of the ground, yet man
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:66159:70"/>
is born unto trouble, as the ſparks flye upward, <hi>Job</hi> 5.6, 7. But if ſores and ſickneſs comes not forth of the duſt, from whence come they then? Surely, from the powerful immediate overruling hand of God. So ſaid <hi>Eliphaz, Job</hi> 17. <hi>Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore deſpiſe not thou the chaſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Almighty: For, he maketh ſore and bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up, he woundeth and his hands make whole.</hi> So <hi>Job</hi> himſelf acknowledged, ch. 19.21. <hi>Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O my friends, for the hand of God hath touched me.</hi> So <hi>David, Thine arrows ſtick faſt in me, and thy hand preſſeth me ſore,</hi> Pſal. 38.2. And conſider, that as a ſparrow falls not to the ground without Gods providence, ſo the <hi>Plagve</hi> and <hi>Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi> and all other Sickneſſes and diſeaſes are gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by his own immediate hand, and he onely doth ſmite when and whom he pleaſeth; and know, that the ſame Powerful hand that took away thy health, can in a moment take away thy breath, and then thou dieſt aad returneſt unto thy duſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.29. This ſhould make thee lye down patiently at the foot of God, and with all willing and chearful reſignation of ſpirit, with good old <hi>Ely,</hi> ſay, <hi>It is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth him good,</hi> 1 Sam. 3.18. And with <hi>Job, Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and ſhall we not receive evil,</hi> Job 2.10. But whatever affliction he layeth upon thy loins, or what ſtrokes ſoever up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any of thy deareſt relations, ſee that thou murmur not, nor charge the Lord fooliſhly or unjuſtly; ſay not with the King of <hi>Iſrael, Behold, this evil is of the Lord, what ſhould I wait for the Lord any longer?</hi> 2 King. 6. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:66159:71"/>2ly. Let the ſence of the mighty hand of God which is upon thee, humble thee deeply; So ſays <hi>Peter, Humble your ſelves under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.6. This will evidence it ſelf inwardly in a ſight and ſence of thine own great unworthineſs, in an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring thy ſelf in duſt and aſhes, and loathing thy ſelf for all thy abominations, in a tender ſenſe of temptations either in thy ſelf or others, in a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of Hypocriſie, a willingneſs to ſuffer afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a contentation in ſome meaſure to the will of God, in what eſtate ſoever it ſhall pleaſe God to bring thee to. Outwardly towards God, it will keep thee lowly in the uſe of means, and in a continual fear and awfulneſs of Gods preſence, not caring to be counted vile for the ſervice of God. And in carriage towards men, it is ſuch a grace as is not affected in words or geſtures, nor is it cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious, arrogant or contentious, but makes a man go before in giving honour, and not to think much to equal himſelf with them of the lower ſort. This is the time now to be narrowly ſearching in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thine own heart and mourn under it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing now thy want of love unto the Lord, and thy abounding love to ſin; do thou cover with ſorrowing, what breach thou haſt made with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and remember, <hi>That had thy ſin never been ſo ſweet, then thy ſorrow had never been ſo bitter.</hi> And know that God is now awaking thee from all thy ſecure ſleeps, that every minutes breathing he lends thee more, may be ſpent in preparing to meet Jeſus Chriſt at the Judgement of the great Day; which that thou mayſt effectually do with all thy might, with fear and trembling, as before the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:66159:71"/>
Lord, remember that the next ſtep (from this life) thou takeſt is into eternity.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. Thus waiting till thy change come, Be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the exerciſe of Faith in the power of thy mighty Redeemer, as to a glorious reſurrection of thy body, when laid aſleep in the grave; <hi>Knowing that he which raiſed up the Lord Jeſus, ſhall raiſe up thee alſo by Jeſus,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.14. <hi>and then this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible ſhall put on incorruption, and then this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſhall put on immortality, and death ſhall be ſwallowed up in victory,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.53, 54.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Act Faith in the mighty power of God in times of great ſinning, and prophanation of the name of God: So <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſpeaking of the cuſtoms of the people that they are vain, and of their Idol-gods, that they are altogether bruitiſh and fooliſh; and the ſtock is a doctrine of vanities; he ſets the great and mighty <hi>Jehovah</hi> againſt all their Heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh gods; <hi>Foraſmuch as there is none like unto thee, O Lord, thou art great, and thy name is great in might. Who would not fear thee, O King of Nations? Jer.</hi> 10.6, 7. So in the 10. verſe. <hi>But the Lord is the true God, he is the living God, and an everlaſting King: At his wrath the earth ſhall tremble, and the Nations ſhall not be able to abide his indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> he ſets Faith on work in the mighty power of God, in a time of great ſinning, and of treacherous and cruel dealing. <hi>Art thou not from everlaſting, O Lord my God, mine Holy One? we ſhall not dye: O Lord thou haſt ordained them for judgement, and O mighty God, thou haſt eſtabliſhed them for correction, Thou art of purer eyes then to behold evil, and canſt not
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:66159:72"/>
look on iniquity. Wherefore lookeſt thou upon them that deal treacherouſly, and holdeſt thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous then he?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Think upon the mighty power of God, when men grow bold and impudent in ſinning, do they oppreſs the poor, and cruſh the needy, <hi>Amos</hi> 4.1 Know that this mighty God can ſoon cruſh them under his feet, <hi>Lament.</hi> 3.34. and feed them that oppreſs thee with their own fleſh, and then they ſhall know the Lord to be the mighty one of <hi>Iſrael, Iſa.</hi> 49.26.</p>
               <p>Does the horrible impieties and wickdneſs of men greive and wound thy heart; Know, that he that is thy God is the God of ſalvation, and he ſhall wound the head of his enemies; and the hairy ſcalp of ſuch a one as goeth on ſtill in his treſpaſs, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 68.20, 21, verſes. And what ſays <hi>Solomon; If thou ſeeſt the oppreſſion of the poor, and violent perverting of Judgement and Juſtice in a Province, Marvaile not at the matter: For he that is higher then the higheſt regardeth; and there be higher then they,</hi> Eccleſ. 5.8.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Act faith in the mighty power of God, as in times of great ſinning, ſo in times of ſerving and worſhipping of God. So did <hi>Daniel,</hi> when <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi> the King had made an Image of gold, and ſet it up to be worſhipped, and that whoſo fell not down and worſhipped the ſaid Image ſhould be caſt into the midſt of a burning fiery ſurnace: <hi>And who is that God</hi> (ſaith he moſt blaſphemouſly) <hi>that ſhall deliver out of my hand?</hi> What ſaid <hi>Sadrach, Meſhaoh</hi> and <hi>Abednego. O</hi>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:66159:72"/>
Nebuchadnezzar, <hi>we are not careful to anſwer thee in this matter. If it be ſo, our God whom we ſerve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O King.</hi> They ſerved God, and they knew that God was able and of power ſufficient to protect them in the ſervice of him, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.1, 11, 16, 17. To this purpoſe, when our dear Lord would encourage his Apoſtles, and the ſubſequent Miniſters of the Goſpel, to be faithful in the execution of his commands, and the truſt committed unto them; He tells them, <hi>that all power was committed unto him in Heaven and in Earth. And therefore go teach all Nations, and Baptiſe them, &amp;c, And teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded you, and loe I am with you allway, even unto the end of the World,</hi> Mat. 28.18, 19, 20. As if he had ſaid, Do you faithfully and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly execute the Commiſſion I have given you, and be aſſured, you ſhall never want my all-ſufficient power and preſence to ſupport you. I will make all the power I have in heaven and earth, concurring in a way of ſerviceableneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O come, let us ſing unto the Lord,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>let us make a joyful noiſe to the Rock of our ſalvation.</hi> Shall we fear to ſerve that God who is the Rock of our Salvation? <hi>Let us come before his preſence with thanksgiving, &amp;c.</hi> Why? <hi>For the Lord is a great God, and a great King above all Gods; in his hand are the deep places of the earth, the ſtrength of the hills is his alſo; the ſea is his, and he made it, and his hands formed the dry land.</hi> If the Lord whom we ſerve is ſo great a God, ſo
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:66159:73"/>
great a King above all Gods, above all Angels, Princes, and Potentates of the World, and above all that is called God; O then with what thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and chearfulneſs of ſpirit ſhould we come into his preſence! <hi>O come let us Worſhip and bow down, let us kneel before the Lord our Maker;</hi> Why? <hi>for he is our God, and we are the people of his paſture, and the ſheep of his hands, whom he makes to lye down in green Paſtures, and leadeth beſides the ſtill waters,</hi> Pſa. 95.1, to 7. So in <hi>Pſa.</hi> 96.6. it is ſaid, <hi>Honour and Majeſty are before him, ſtrength and beauty are in his ſanctuary;</hi> Where is the beauty of Gods face ſeen, and his power and ſtrength diſplayed, as in his Sanctuary? to wit, his Tabernacle, his Temple, the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations and Aſſemblies of his Saints. <hi>God is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be feared in the Aſſembly of the Saints: and to be had in reverence by all them that are about him:</hi> and why? why? <hi>who in Heaven can be compared unto the Lord? Who among the Sons of the mighty can be likened unto the Lord?</hi> Pſa. 89.6, 7. And therefore it is, that the Lord hath ſpoken, ſaying, <hi>I will be ſanctified in them that come nigh me,</hi> Lev. 10.3. When a fire went out from the Lord, and deſtroyed <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> the Sons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> for offering ſtrange fire before the Lord, <hi>Lev.</hi> 10.1, 2, 3. To which I ſuppoſe that place in the <hi>Hebrews</hi> hath a ſpecial reference, where the Saints being exhorted to ſerve God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably with reverence and godly fear, urges this as a ſtrong motive thereunto, for our God (ſaith he) <hi>is a conſuming fire,</hi> Heb. 12.28, 29. Thus you ſee how requiſite it is to be acting Faith in the power and ſoveraignty of God, when we
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:66159:73"/>
draw nigh to him in the ſolemn duties of his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ſervice; and what an encouragement it is, to be fearing the Lord, and ſerving of him in ſincerity and truth, with all our hearts, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what great things he hath done for us, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.24.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Act faith in the mighty power of God in times of ſuffering. So the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> ſpeaking of the cruelties that were exerciſed againſt the Saints in thoſe days, how they had condemned and killed the juſt, and they could not reſiſt them; He exhorts them to be patient to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lord; and why to the coming of the Lord? Becauſe when he comes, <hi>he will come with power and great glory,</hi> Mat. 24.30. When he comes, hee'l take to him his great power and reign, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.17. When he comes, he will come <hi>with ten thouſand of his Saints;</hi> What to do? <hi>To execute Judgement upon all, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince all that are ungodly, of all their ungodly deeds, which they have ungodly committed, &amp;c.</hi> Jude, verſ. 14, 15. When he comes, he will come <hi>with fire, and with his chariots, like a Whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire,</hi> Iſa. 66.15. When he comes, he will come <hi>with vengeance, even God with a recompence, he will come and ſave you,</hi> Iſa. 35.4. <hi>And then the hand of the Lord,</hi> (the power of God) <hi>ſhall be known towards his ſervants, and his indignation towards his enemies,</hi> Iſa. 66.14. So the Author to the Hebrews, when he exhorts the Saints to a patient ſuffering and undergoing of the Croſs of Chriſt; what Argument does he
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:66159:74"/>
uſe? even this, <hi>For yet a little while, and he that ſhall come, will come, and will not tarry,</hi> Heb. 10.37. The Apoſtle would have all the ſuffering Saints to be acting faith in a powerful Redeemer, even in him who is mighty to ſave, <hi>That will tread down the people in his anger, and make them drunk in his fury, and will bring down their ſtrength to the earth,</hi> Iſa 63.6. So the Apoſtles, (when the Prieſts and Rulers of the people had laid hands on them, and put them in hold, for teaching the People, and Preaching through Jeſus the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the dead, and had further threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them for ſpeaking any more in the name of Jeſus, and had let them go) what Arguments in Prayer do they uſe? <hi>Lord thou art God, which haſt made Heaven and Earth, and the Sea, and all that in them is. Who by the mouth of thy ſervant</hi> David, <hi>haſt ſaid, why did the Heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things? The Kings of the Earth ſtood up, and the Rulers were gathered together againſt the Lord, and againſt his Chriſt. For of a truth againſt thy holy Child Jeſus, whom thou haſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed, both</hi> Herod <hi>and</hi> Pontius Pilate, <hi>with the Gentiles, and the people of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>were gathered together, for to do whatſoever thy hand, and thy counſel determined before to be done. And now Lord behold their threatnings,</hi> Act. 4. Though they had to deal with great and potent Adverſaries, yet they well knew, that God was above them, and that their rage and fury was not ſo much againſt them, as againſt the Lord <hi>Jehovah</hi> himſelf, and againſt his Chriſt, whom he had anointed to be the chief Prieſt, and Prophet, and King of his Church, who could eaſily break them with
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:66159:74"/>
his rod of Iron, and daſh them in peices like a Potters Veſſel. They knew that the Lord whom they ſerved, was able to deliver them, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> out of the Lions mouths. So it is ſaid of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and laid down as a ſingular act of Faith in him, <hi>that he forſook</hi> Egypt, <hi>and feared not the wrath of the King, for he endured as ſeeing him who is inviſible,</hi> Heb. 11.27. Now this was an act of Faith in the power of God. He knew, that though he might incur the wrath of an enraged King by refuſing the honours and dignities of his Court; yet his eye being fixt upon a moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful inviſible Lord God, that was ſufficient to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him under all the ſufferings he might undergo for his ſake. And that this Lord was able to ſtrike through Kings in the day of his wrath, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 110.5. In which ſpirit of faith and confidence <hi>David</hi> brake forth, when he ſaid, <hi>Though I walk in the midſt of trouble, thou wilt revive me, thou ſhalt ſtretch forth thine hand againſt the wrath of mine enemies, and thy right hand ſhall ſave me,</hi> Pſa. 138.7. So <hi>Paul</hi> that tried Apoſtle, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous ſufferer for Chriſt; <hi>For which cauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I alſo ſuffer theſe things, nevertheleſs I am not aſhamed, for I know whom I have beleived, and I am perſwaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him againſt that day. He acts faith in the ability and all-ſufficiency of God, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him through all difficulties and hardſhip for Chriſt,</hi> 2 Tim 1.12. And upon this ſcore it was, he ſo much incouraged his Son <hi>Timothy</hi> in the faith, as to a ſuffering ſtate for Chriſt. <hi>Be not therefore aſhamed of the Teſtimony of our Lord, nor of me his Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:66159:75"/>
Goſpel according to the power of God,</hi> as in the 8. <hi>verſ.</hi> of that <hi>Chap.</hi> Whether he meant Chriſt the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. Or whether he would have him bear thoſe afflictions patiently, as God afforded him power and ſtrength; yet ſurely, it cannot exclude, but take in the exerciſe of his faith in the power of God, in all his ſufferings for Chriſt, whoſe power will ever be manifeſted in weakneſs. And therefore it is, that we are exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be looking up unto Jeſus the Author and Finiſher of our Faith, who for the joy that was ſet before him, endured the Croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame, and is ſet down at the right hand of the throne of God, at the right hand of Gods power. For conſider him that endured ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction of ſinners againſt himſelf, leſt ye be wearied and faint in your minds.</p>
               <p>Now this looking up unto Jeſus, is not only a looking up unto him as a pattern and example of patience, in our ſufferings and perſecutions, for his and the Goſpels ſake; but we muſt look upon him alſo, as made perfect by ſuffering, who for the ſuffering of death is now crowned with glory and honor; as him, whom God hath highly exalted, and ſet at the right hand of the throne of God, where he muſt ſit and reign till all his enemies be made his foot-ſtool, or as the Apoſtle expreſſeth it, <hi>Till he hath put all his enemies under his feet,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.25 Thus you ſee how neceſſary it is to be Acting faith, as in the blood of Chriſt, ſo in the power of God.</p>
               <p>And that Firſt, In times of great difficulties and ſtraights.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In times of ſore ſickneſſes and deaths.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:66159:75"/>3. In times of great ſinning.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In times of ſerving and worſhipping of God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In times of ſuffering for God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, We are to Act Faith in the faithfulneſs of God. <hi>Know therefore</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes) that the Lord thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and mercy, with them that love him, and keep his commandments to a thouſand generations,</hi> Deut. 7.9. The conſideration whereof, made the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> break forth into this pious interrogation or expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulation rather, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.8. <hi>O Lord God of Hoſts, who is a ſtrong Lord like unto thee? or to thy faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs round about thee?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Conſider then that this Faith in the faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God is to be acted upon ſeveral accounts.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Upon the account of the unchangable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Gods love, and the immutability of the Covenant of Grace, which he hath made with us in his Son, and which he hath ratified and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto us in his moſt precious blood. See the 89. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>David</hi> as a Type of Chriſt, The Lord promiſeth there, <hi>That the enemy ſhall not exact upon him, nor the ſon of wickedneſs afflict him; And that he will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them that hate him. But my faithfulneſs</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and my mercies ſhall be with him,</hi> Ver. 22, 23, 24. So in the 30, 31, 32, 33, <hi>and</hi> 34. <hi>Verſ.</hi> of that Pſalm. <hi>If his Children forſake my law, and walk not in my judgments. If they break my ſtatutes, and keep not my Commandments, then will I viſit their tranſgreſſion with the rod, and their iniquity with ſtripes.</hi> But what follows? <hi>Nevertheleſs my loving kindneſs will I not utterly take from him, nor ſuffer my faithfulneſs to fail. My Covenant will I not break, nor alter the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:66159:76"/>
thing that is gone out of my lips.</hi> So <hi>David</hi> in the 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. <hi>Although my houſe be not ſo with God, yet he hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in all things, and ſure.</hi> Now that Gods love in Chriſt is unchangable, as it is founded upon the immutability of the New-covenant of Grace, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is dearer then a Mothers love to her ſweeteſt, and moſt tender Babe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.15. <hi>Can a woman forget her ſucking child, that ſhe ſhould not have compaſſion on the ſon of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet I will not forget thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is ſtronger then the Mountains, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.10. <hi>For the mountains ſhall depart, and the hills be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, but my kindneſs ſhall not depart from thee, neither ſhall the Covenant of my peace be removed, ſaith the Lord, that hath mercy on thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It is as conſtant as the courſes of the Sun, Moon, and Sars, of the Day, and of the Night, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.35, 36. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, which giveth the ſun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon, and of the ſtars for a light by night, which divideth the ſea when the waves thereof roar, the Lord of Hoſts is his name. If thoſe ordinances depart from before me, ſaith the Lord, then the ſeed of</hi> Iſrael <hi>alſo ſhall ceaſe from being a Nation before me for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. It is as ſure as God himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.35. <hi>Once have I ſworn by my holineſs, that I will not lye unto</hi> David. <hi>His ſeed ſhall endure for ever, and his throne as the ſun before me. It ſhall be eſtabliſhed for ever as the Moon, and as a faithful witneſs in heaven.</hi> We give much credit to the word of an honeſt man, much more when we have his oath for it. This the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> makes the ground or
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:66159:76"/>
foundation of a Beleivers ſtrong conſolation. <hi>Wherein God willing more abundantly to ſhew un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heirs of promiſe the immutability of his counſel, confirmed it by an oath, That by two immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things, in which it was impoſſible for God to lye we might have a ſtrong conſolation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope ſet hefore us, which hope we have as an anchor of the ſoul both ſure and ſtedfaſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17, 18, 19. And this was it without all queſtion, that made the Apoſtle break out with that holy boldneſs, and exultation of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. <hi>Who ſhall ſeperate us from the love of Chriſt, ſhall tribulation, or diſtreſs, or perſecution, or famine, or nakedneſs, or peril, or ſword? Nay, in all theſe things we are more then Conquerors through him that loved us. For I am perſwaded</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther death, nor life, nor Angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, ſhall be able to ſeperate us from the love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord,</hi> Rom. 8.35. to the end. Now this ſtability, and firmneſs of Gods love, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the faithfulneſs of God, may be a great ſupport to the poor doubting ſoul, that is apt to queſtion the Love of God, and the certainty of its eternal eſtate in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. This Faith in Gods faithfulneſs, is to be acted upon the account of our Vocation or Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to, and confirmation or eſtabliſhment in the Grace of God. <hi>God is faithful</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) by whom ye were called unto the fellowſhip of his Son Jeſus Chriſt our Lord: And therefore will he confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameleſs in the day of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.8, 9. That God who
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:66159:77"/>
hath called you unto the communion, or fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of his Son; not externally only, in point of Ordinances, Church-fellowſhip, and Publique-worſhip, whereby we profeſs to have communion with Chriſt, and his benefits; but internally in a ſpecial manner, whereby we are really united to him by faith, and by the ſpirit of Chriſt, and ſo are made partakers indeed of all the glorious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, priviledges, and advantages of his death, reſurrection, aſcenſion, interceſſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3. This God who hath ſo called you, is the faithful God, faithful in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of all his promiſes he hath made, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm you unto the end, not to leave you, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake you, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. as many freinds do in time of adverſity; not to caſt you off, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.1, 2. as many Parents do their Children; not to forget you, as many cruel and unnatural Women do their ſucking children, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.15.</p>
               <p>No ſurely, he will not do it, his faithfulneſs is engaged to ſtand by you; fear not, he will be with thee: be not diſmayed, he is thy God; he will ſtrengthen thee, yea, he will help thee, yea, <hi>He will uphold thee with the right hand of his righteouſneſs,</hi> Iſa. 41.10. <hi>And make an everlaſting Covenant with thee, that he will not turn away from thee to do thee good, but will put his fear into thy heart, that thou ſhalt not depart from him,</hi> Jer. 32.40. So the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> praying for the <hi>Theſſaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> that the very God of peace migh ſanctifie them wholly, and that their whole ſpirit, and ſoul, and body, might be preſerved blameleſs unto the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: He makes this the ground of his confidence, <hi>Faithful is he that calleth
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:66159:77"/>
you, who alſo will do it,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.23, 24. So 2 Theſſ. 3.3. <hi>But the Lord is faithful, who ſhall ſtabliſh you and keep you from evil.</hi> Why ſhouldſt thou then fear of falling away, or of thy perſevering in the grace of God, when Gods faithfulneſs is enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged forthy eſtabliſhment?</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. This faith in Gods faithfulneſs is to be acted upon the accompt of a Chriſtians temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and conflictings with ſin and Satan, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10 13. <hi>There hath no temptation taken you, but ſuch as is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to man: but God is faithful</hi> (obſerve that I pray you) <hi>who will not ſuffer you to be tempted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove that you are able, but will with the temptation alſo make a way to eſcape, that ye may be able to bear it.</hi> Thou poor tempted ſoul, thou thinkeſt perhaps, that no temptations are like unto thine, but thou art miſtaken, thy temptations are not ſingular, but in common with others, other men have been exerciſed with the like. And thou art apt to think, thou ſhalt ſink under thy temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, thou findeſt ſo little ſtrength to undergo them, but what ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>God is faithful, and will not ſuffer you to be tempted above your ſtrength,</hi> but will proportion ſuitable ſtrength, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your trials. Gods Faithfulneſs is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to help you and to ſupport you under all your temptations and trials. Would Satan then make thee beleive that thy ſins are of that nature and magnitude that they ſhall not be forgiven, think upon Gods faithfulneſs then who is engaged to pardon thee. So ſaith <hi>John,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. <hi>If we confeſt our ſins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſs.</hi> It would be an act of unfaithfulneſs and injuſtice
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:66159:78"/>
in God, if he ſhould not pardon and forgive poor penitent ſinners who confeſs and forſake their ſins. But God is faithful and juſt, and cannot falſifie his word; <hi>If we beleive not, yet he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth faithful, he cannot deny himſelf,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.13.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This acting of faith in Gods faithfulneſs is of excellent uſe in order to our ſtanding faſt in the faith, and continuing in our publique faithful teſtimony for the Lord, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.23. <hi>Let us hold faſt the profeſſion of our faith without wavering</hi> (and why?) <hi>for he is faithful that hath promiſed,</hi> faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in performing what he hath promiſed, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 23.14. And what hath he promiſed? Surely, as hath been declared before, <hi>to eſtabliſh and keep us from evil, and confirm us unto the end,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.8. According to that alſo in 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.3. <hi>But the Lord is faithful, who ſhall eſtabliſh you, and keep you from evil:</hi> Stabliſh you in the faith, leſt you fall from it; and keep you from evil, to wit, the Devil, leſt he ſubvert your faith by evil men, as the inſtruments of his art; or it may be taken more generally, for any evil; as the Apoſtle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares in the 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.18. <hi>And the Lord ſhall deliver me from every evil work, and will preſerve me unto his heavenly Kingdom.</hi> And therefore we may up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this conſideration be much encouraged to hold faſt our profeſſion, and not to be ſtaggaring or wavering in our honourable and faithful teſtimony for the Lord.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This acting of faith in Gods faithfulneſs is of excellent uſe to encourage us as to a ſuffering ſtate for Chriſt, and to Chriſtian contentation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Croſs. <hi>It is a faithful ſaying</hi> (ſaith the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:66159:78"/>
Apoſtle) <hi>that if we be dead with him, we ſhall alſo live with him; If we ſuffer, we ſhall alſo reign with him,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.11, 12. Rule or reign as Kings, ſo the word it ſeems imports, if we endure all manner of tribulations with patience and ſtedfaſtneſs in the faith. And <hi>it is a faithful ſaying</hi> (ſaith he) a certain, ſure, firm, credible, ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revocable word, not to be queſtioned or doubted. Or we ſhall be glorified together with him, as the Apoſtle expreſſeth it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. and Gods faithfulneſs is engaged to make it good; whence is that exhortation of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.16, 19. In the 16. verſe he tells them, <hi>That if any man ſuffer as a Chriſtian</hi> (and not as an evil doer) <hi>let him not be aſhamed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>but let him glorifie God on this behalf.</hi> And then in the 19. verſe. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let them that ſuffer according to the will of God, commit the keeping of their ſouls to him in well-doing, as unto a faithful Creator.</hi> God is not onely a powerful Creator, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> alſo a faithful Creator, a ſure Preſerver, who will faithfully recompenſe all your hard ſervices and ſufferings you undergo for his ſake.</p>
               <p>He is as faithful as he is able; according to that of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> encouraging him to be a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of the afflictions of the Goſpel, and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his own ſufferings upon the ſame account; <hi>Nevertheleſs</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I am not aſhamed, for I know whom I have beleived, and I am perſwaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him againſt that day,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.12. And what was that which he had committed to Gods cuſtody? His Soul, ſaith one; himſelf (which is all one) ſaith another; his works, ſaith a third; a fourth ſaith
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:66159:79"/>
his ſufferings; a fifth his ſalvation. All which put together, he committed unto God his ſoul, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, his doings, his ſufferings, his ſalvation, his all.</p>
               <p>And he was perſwaded he was as able as faithful, and as faithful as able to keep that which he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto his truſt; The Goſpel, that the Lord had committed to his keeping, and his Soul he had committed unto Gods keeping: And becauſe the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> knew that God was a faithful Creator, therefore did he encourage the Saints ſuffering ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will of God, to commit the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of their ſouls unto him; who as he had crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them immortal ſouls, ſo he would not leave them as Maſons and Carpenters leave their houſes which they build, but would faithfully keep and and preſerve them. As the Lord himſelf declares, ſpeaking of his Vineyard of red wine, his Church, whether red, upon the account of the preciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its fruits, or elſe of its bloody ſufferings, <hi>I the Lord do keep it</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I will water it every moment, leſt any hurt it, I will keep it night and day,</hi> Iſa. 27.2, 3.</p>
               <p>Fourthly and laſtly, We are to act faith in the Promiſes of God, whether they are ſuch as are of a temporal or of a ſpiritual and eternal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment; and know for thine everlaſting comfort, thou beleiving Soul, that as the promiſes of God are the ground of our hope, and the object of our faith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.49. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.35.36. and chap. 11.11. So are they all firm and irrevocable in Chriſt; <hi>For all the promiſes of God in him</hi> (that is in Chriſt) <hi>are yea, and in
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:66159:79"/>
him are Amen, unto the glory of God, &amp;c.</hi> 2 Cor. 1.20. They are not yea and nay, but in Chriſt they are yea; that is, true in the event, and as to their performance: And <hi>Amen,</hi> that is ſtable and firm, being made and performed in and for Chriſt.</p>
               <p>For even as Chriſt is always the ſame in Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes which are unchangeable, ſo are all Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of our ſalvation firm and certain in Chriſt: and as certain, ſo are they general and indefinite, and made to all that ſhall beleive, excluding none but thoſe that are finally impenitent. Conſider a few of them to this purpoſe; <hi>Hee every one that thirſteth, Come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money, Come ye, buy and eat, yea, come buy wine and milk without money and without price. Incline your ear, and come unto me, hear and your ſouls ſhall live; and I will make an everlaſting covenant with you, even the ſure mercies of</hi> David, Iſa. 55.1, 3. So <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and I will give you reſt.</hi> Mark 16.16. <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiveth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved, but he that beleiveth not ſhall be damned.</hi> 1 Joh. 2.1. <hi>If any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt the righteous, and he is the propitiation for our ſins, and not for ours onely, but alſo for the ſins of the whole world.</hi> Joh. 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world that he gave his onely begotten Son, that whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiveth in him, ſhould not periſh but have everlaſting life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Joh. 5.24. <hi>Verily, verily I ſay unto you; He that heareth my word, and beleiveth on him that ſent me, hath everlaſting life, and ſhall not come into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, but is paſſed from death unto life.</hi> Joh.
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:66159:80"/>
6.37. <hi>All that the Father giveth me, ſhall come unto me, &amp; him that cometh to me I will in no wiſe caſt out,</hi> v. 40. <hi>And this is the will of him that ſent me, that every one which ſeeth the Son, and beleiveth on him, may have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting life, and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day,</hi> verſ. 47. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, he that beleiveth on me hath everlaſting life,</hi> Act 40.43. <hi>To him</hi> (meaning Chriſt) <hi>give all the Prophets witneſs, that through his name, whoſoever beleiveth in him, ſhall receive remiſſion of ſins,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.15. <hi>This is a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Chriſt Jeſus came into the World to ſave ſinners, of whom I am chief,</hi> who gave himſelf a ranſom for all, to be teſtified in due time, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.25. <hi>I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions for mine own ſake, and will not remember thy ſins.</hi> So Chap. 44.22. <hi>I have blotted out as a thick cloud thy tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and as a cloud thy ſins: return unto me, for I have redeemed thee,</hi> Heb. 8.8. <hi>Behold the days come (ſaith the Lord) when I ſhall make a new Covenant with the houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and with the houſe of</hi> Judah, <hi>For this is the Covenant that I will make with the houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>after thoſe days (ſaith the Lord) I will put my Laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they ſhall be to me a people,</hi> and in the 12. verſe, <hi>For I will be merciful to their unrighteouſneſs, and their ſins, and their iniquities will I remember no more.</hi> Theſe are ſome of thoſe ſweet ſoul-ſupporting promiſes, which are made indefinitely to all, and have their, yea, and Amen in Chriſt, excluding none, but the wilful and final impenitent, and unbeleiving ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. But perhaps thou wilt ſay, thou haſt relapſed and fallen into ſin again, after repentance, and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:66159:80"/>
thou thinkeſt thy relapſes cannot be pardoned. Remember that men who have not a drop of mercy, in compariſon of God, are obliged to forgive the repenting offender, though he offend ſeventy ſeven times; God much more, who is infinite in mercy, hath bound himſelf, by his moſt firme and faithful promiſes, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. <hi>and</hi> 2.1. Upon true and renewed repentance, often to forgive and forget the ſame ſin, iterated again and again, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.3, 4. <hi>That though thy ſins were as Crimſon, they ſhall be made as white as Snow;</hi> And he calls to back ſliding <hi>Iſrael</hi> to return, and promiſes to heal their back-ſlidings, and love them freely, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 3.14. comp. with <hi>Hoſea</hi> 14.4.</p>
               <p>So in pangs of the New-birth, ſpiritual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, weakneſs of Faith, Prayer, Godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and other graces, let ſuch cordial refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Promiſes, as theſe dwell upon thy heart, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.6. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.3. <hi>and</hi> 57.15. <hi>and</hi> 40.11. which import; How God will ſatisfie the hungry ſoul, tender the weak and feeble ſoul, dwel with the humble ſoul; yea the exerciſe of faith alſo in the promiſes is of ſingular uſe in all kinds and varieties of temptations, ſpiritual deſertions, deep &amp; almoſt deſpairing apprehenſions of thine extreme vileneſs and nothingneſs in grace, in which dark, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal and diſconſolate eſtate, let thy faith be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed on ſuch precious ſoul-ſupporting promiſes as theſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.18. and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.25. Which ſpeaks to this effect; <hi>That God is faithful, and will not ſuffer us to be tempted above our ſtrength. That we ſhould count it all joy when we fall into divers temptations. That all they are bleſſed that wait for the Lord.</hi> So that if thou eieſt
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:66159:81"/>
in this waiting ſtate, thou ſhalt be certainly ſaved, for the holy ſpirit pronounceth thee bleſſed. And further, for the exceeding great comfort and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of thy ſoul, that, <hi>it is the Lord, and he onely that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions for his own ſake, and will not remember thy ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So in the Hail-ſtorms of ſlanderous Arrows, and empoyſoned Darts of diſgrace, how ſhould thy Faith be fixt upon ſuch pretious Promiſes as theſe, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.18. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.11. Yea, in the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of the ſhadow of death, by an aſſurance of Gods merciful omnipotent preſence, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 23.4. And in the extremity and depth of ſuch deſperate diſtreſſes and perplexities, wherein in thy preſent feeling, thou canſt ſee and find no poſſibility of help from Heaven or Earth, God or man, but art both helpleſs and hopeleſs, as the Church complains, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.18. Let thy meditations dwell upon ſuch like precious promiſes as theſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.9, 10. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.12. <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.65, 66. <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.14. All which import, that in the Mount of the greateſt difficulties, God will be ſeen. Well, in every thing, or any thing that ſhall or can poſſibly befall thee, proſperity or poverty, croſs or comfort, calmneſs of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, or tempeſts of terror, life or death, thou maiſt by Faith extract abundance of uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querable patience and peace of ſoul, from thoſe three heavenly golden conduits of ſweeteſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18. <hi>and</hi> 28.32, to wit, <hi>That the ſufferings of this preſent time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that ſhall be revealed in us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That all things ſhall work together for good to them that love God.</hi>
               </p>

                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:66159:81"/>3. <hi>That he that ſpared not his own Son, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But may I act faith in the Promiſes for things temporal, as for ſpiritual?</hi> Yea, <hi>for godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hath the Promiſe of the life that now is, as of that which is to come,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.8. Yet conſider withal, that temporal things are not promiſed ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, but conditionally.</p>
               <p n="1">1. With limitation to expediency.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By way of commutation and compenſation with ſpiritual; If he gives thee not peace, he will give thee patience, if not wealth, yet content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which may be far better.</p>
               <p n="3">3. With exception of the Croſs, Houſes, and Brethren, and Siſters, and Lands with perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.30. So then we may believe, we ſhall have temporal bleſſings, which God hath promiſed conditionally, ſo far forth as will ſtand with theſe conditions, his own glory, our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual good, and everlaſting ſalvation. This life, is but, <hi>via advitam,</hi> the way to life, and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God promiſeth us in the way, is, but to help us to the end of our journey. There is no tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral thing of this life falls within the compaſs of Gods promiſe, but ſo far forth as it ſhall be a help and furtherance unto us, as to our eternal life. I ſhall therefore preſent unto thy view, a few of thoſe Promiſes, which are of a temporal concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as having reference to long Life, Children, Lands, Riches, Honour, and external Peace and Plenty; See to this purpoſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.17. <hi>and</hi> 49.15. <hi>Le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

128.2, 3, 4. and many ſuch like, which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded upon the diligent and exact obſervation of Gods Law, and the fear of the Lord.

the midſt of thee;</hi> So <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.12, 15. <hi>If ye hearken to theſe judgements, and keep and do them, the Lord thy God ſhall keep unto thee the Covenant and the mercy which he ſware unto thy Fathers; And he will love thee and bleſs thee, and multiply thee.</hi> And in the 15. verſ. <hi>The Lord will take away from thee all ſickneſs, and will put none of the evil diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of</hi> Egypt <hi>upon thee, but will lay them upon all them that hate thee.</hi> So in the Prayer that <hi>Solomon</hi> made, at the Feaſt of the Dedication of the Temple, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.37, 38, 39. <hi>If there be in the Land Famine, if there be Peſtilence, &amp;c. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Plague, whatſoever ſickneſs there be, what prayer and ſupplication ſoever be made by any man, which ſhall know the plague of his own heart; Then hear thou in Heaven thy dwelling place, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, and do, and give to every man according to his ways, whoſe heart thou knoweſt;</hi> And the Lord graciouſly promiſed, that he would do according to his prayer and ſupplication that he had made, 1 <hi>King</hi> 9.3. So <hi>Pſa.</hi> 41. <hi>Bleſſed is he that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth the poor, the Lord will deliver him in time of trouble. The Lord will preſerve him and keep him alive, and he ſhall be bleſſed upon the Earth, and thou wilt not deliver him into the will of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. The Lord will ſtrengthen him upon the bed of languiſhing, thou wilt make all his bed in his ſickneſs;</hi> So Pſa. 91.3, 6, 7, 10. <hi>Surely, he ſhall deliver thee from the noyſom Peſtilence, Thou ſhalt not be afraid of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

will ſtrengthen him upon the bed of languiſhing; Tbou wilt make all his bed in his ſickneſs.</hi> Art thou there where the ſick are? apply; <hi>I will take away all ſickneſs from the midſt of thee.</hi> Feareſt thou the Peſtilence? <hi>I will deliver thee, ſaith the Lord, from the noyſome Peſtilence.</hi> So that of <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaz</hi> to <hi>Job; He ſhall deliver thee in ſix troubles, yea, in ſeven, there ſhall no evil touch thee; in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine he ſhall redeem thee from death, and in War from the power of the Sword. Thou ſhalt be hid from the ſcourge of the Tongue, neither ſhalt thou be afraid of deſtruction when it cometh, &amp;c. And thou ſhalt know that thy Tabernacle ſhall be in peace,</hi> Job 5.19.20, 21, 24. So in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.2. The Lord promiſeth he will be with us in the fire, and in the water, the waters ſhall not overflow us, nor the fire devour us; And in <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. he hath promiſed likewiſe, that he will never leave thee nor forſake thee; The labour of the Olive may fail, as <hi>Habakkuk</hi> ſpeaks; our neareſt and dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt friends and relations may fail, our eyes may fail, our tongue may fail, our ſtrength may fail, our fleſh and heart may fail, our ſpirits may fail; yet ſaith the Lord, <hi>I will be with thee, I will not fail thee nor forſake thee; When the poor and the needy ſeek water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirſt, I the Lord will hear them, I the God of</hi> Iſrael <hi>will not forſake them,</hi> Iſa. 41.17. What can be more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing and ſupporting to the poor languiſhing fainting, ſinking ſoul? Thus in any trouble of ſoul, body, good name, outward ſtate, preſent or to come, thou maiſt by the ſoveraign power of ſaith, working upon the word of his promiſe,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:66159:83"/>
not only draw out the ſting, and expell the poiſon of it; but alſo procure a great deal of comfort to thy truly humbled ſoul, and maintain it in deſpight of all mortal or infernal oppoſition, in a conſtant ſpiritual gladneſs. Conſidering, that all thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes whereupon thy heavy and diſconſolate heart in ſuch caſes may repoſe and refreſh it ſelf, have their being and confirmation from the bleſſed name <hi>Jehovah</hi> it ſelf, ſee <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.3. and therefore as ſure as God himſelf; they are ſealed with the bloody ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrings of his only Son, and therefore as true as Truth it ſelf; and if thou art in Chriſt, are all as certainly thine, as the heart in thy body, or blood that runs in thy veins. Nay, and a little more for thy comfort, the glory of Gods Truth is mightily advanced, and himſelf extraordinarily pleaſed, by thy more reſolute, ſtedfaſt and triumphant cleaving unto them. What a bleſſed, ſweet and heavenly life then is the Life of Faith, as it is exerciſed in the Promiſes of God?</p>
               <p>O then be encouraged to be acting Faith in the Promiſes, and to be ſtoring up a good ſtock of Promiſes every day. They are of excellent uſe in all eſtates, in all conditions, in all kind of diſtreſſes whatſoever. By beleiving the Promiſes we ſhall proſper, by beleiving and applying of them, we ſhall come to participate of the Divine Nature, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. And therefore they are called exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great and precious promiſes, <hi>That by theſe</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>you might be partakers of the Divine Nature;</hi> not of the ſubſtance, but of the quality. <hi>Non transformatione naturae humanae in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinam, ſed participatione donorum, quibus conformes efficimur divinae naturae,</hi> as one diſtinguiſheth very
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:66159:84"/>
well; not by the transformation of the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into the divine, but by the participation of gifts whereby we are made conformable to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature. And ſo it notes a fellowſhip with God in his holineſs, and a fellowſhip with God in his bleſſedneſs, that is, in the beatifical viſion and brightneſs of glory; upon which account, as to the excellent uſe and nature of them, one terms them a Chriſtians <hi>Catholicon,</hi> a general purging Medicine, a Salve for every ſore, being a help to all duties, a quickner of all graces, and a comfort in all diſtreſſes. And like a well-fill'd Apothaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſhop, there is contained in them, heavenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts of all ſorts, wholeſome phyſick of every kind, for expelling and curing all ſorts of diſeaſes and ſickneſſes incident to Saints, and for the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborating and ſtrengthening of the new nature, and keeping the ſpiritual man in a good healthful conſtitution, luſty and ſtrong, able for Gods Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and for working out his own ſalvation with fear and trembling.</p>
               <p>Wouldſt thou then have thy faith like the Light in the Lords Sanctuary, never to go out? then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint thy ſelf with Gods Promiſes, know them well, meditate on them, confer about them: let them be continually in thy mind, memory, heart and tongue. Satan laboureth in nothing more, then to keep us in unbeleif, eſpecially of particular promiſes; for he knows, if we beleive them, we ſhall in all things have the victory: Come before God with boldneſs, carry peace in our own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes to our graves, and do, and ſuffer any thing for God.</p>
               <p>Oh, the abundance of ſweet cordial comfort,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:66159:84"/>
which all humble beleiving ſouls draw by faith out of every promiſe. And theſe precious promiſes (our breaſts of conſolation) whereupon our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and happineſs ſo much depend, lye hid in the holy Scriptures, as veins of gold in the earth. How then ſhould we be ſearching into thoſe rich mines that bring to light ſuch heavenly treaſures? and how ſhould it ſtir us up to go to God in prayer, for the accompliſhment of them unto us, and wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the diligent uſe of all means for the gaining of them? you ſhall find God not only making you heirs of Promiſes, but you ſhall be comfortable poſſeſſors of thoſe many good things, which God hath promiſed to beleivers. And the more you meditate, and the oftner you pray upon them, the more good will you ſee in them, and find to flow from them. And this leads me to the next Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Receipt and Soveraign Antidote, and that is Prayer.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="receipt">
               <head>The Fourth Spiritual Receit.</head>
               <p n="4">4ly. The fourth ſpecial Receit and preſervative againſt this contagious diſeaſe, or which may be of excellent force and efficacy for the removal of it; is <hi>faithful and fervent Prayer.</hi> This is a tried re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt, an approved remedy; of which I may ſay, as <hi>David</hi> ſaid to <hi>Abimelech</hi> the Preiſt, concerning the Sword of <hi>Goliah, There is none like to it,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.9. A moſt incomparable weapon, if we have skill to uſe it.</p>
               <p>Let us conſider a little then what Prayer is, as to the derivation and definition of it. I find that Prayer comes of a word in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:66159:85"/>
                  <hi>Appeal;</hi> whereby we refer the Cauſe of our ſelves or others unto God, as unto the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Judge; calling upon him, appealing unto him for right, preſenting our ſelves and our cauſe unto him, as to one who hath power to determine Cauſes, and to whom appeals may be made. And if you would have a breif deſcription of it, it is the pouring out of the humble, penitent, belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſoul before the Lord, 1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 1.15. Or as one very pithily defines it, It is <hi>Devotae animae cum Deo colloquium,</hi> that is, It is the talk or conference of the devout ſoul with God. For a man barely to ſpeak in the air, and his heart have no approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches unto God in it, this is no Prayer in Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. I cannot therefore let paſs, that excellent ſaying of <hi>Bernard, Cum oramus, cum Deo loquimur, cum legimus, Deus nobiſcum loquitur: Si vis cum Deo ſemper eſſe, ſemper ora, &amp; ſemper lege;</hi> that is, When we pray, we ſpeak with God; when we read, God ſpeaketh with us: If thou wilt always be with God, then always pray, and always read. More plainly and fully: <hi>It is a work of the ſpirit of Chriſt in the beleiving ſoul, by which we deſire of God alone, things lawful and needful, with confidence to obtain them, through the alone mediation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of Chriſt, to the praiſe and glory of his name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then, if thou wilt pray aright, and find ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with God therein; thou muſt pray to him, and to him alone; in the name, and through the alone mediation and interceſſion of Chriſt, by the powerful, and immediate help and aſſiſtance of his own ſpirit; and that beleivingly, from the heart, with underſtanding, and feeling of our
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:66159:85"/>
wants, in fervency of ſpirit, forgivingly, reverent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and perſeveringly: Without which ingredients, never think of putting up an acceptable Prayer unto God, with any confidence or aſſurance to be heard at the throne of grace.</p>
               <p>I ſhall touch a little upon the particulars, for the help of ſuch poor ſouls, whoſe deſires are to grow into a more ſpiritual acquaintance with God.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, If thou wilt pray aright, thou muſt pray to God, and to him only, and that in the name of Chriſt. God alone is to be invocated and prayed unto, not Saints, nor Angels. Chriſt in his prayer which he taught his Diſciples, would have us direct our Petitions unto God our Father which is in Heaven, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.2. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.9 And why to God alone?</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe God onley is <hi>Omni preſent,</hi> every where preſent, in all places, and at all times. But this is inconſiſtent to any creature to be <hi>ubiquitary,</hi> or preſent in all places. But that God is ſo, ſee <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.23, 24. <hi>Am I a God at hand</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>and not a God a far off? Can any hide himſelf in ſecret places, that I ſhall not ſee him, ſaith the Lord? Do not I fill heaven and earth, ſaith the Lord?</hi> ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.7, 8. <hi>God is not only the God of the hills, but of the valleys alſo,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20.28.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe God as he is <hi>Omni-preſent,</hi> ſo he is <hi>Omniſcient;</hi> he knoweth all things; all the hearts of the Sons of men. So ſaid <hi>Solomon</hi> in the prayer he made at the Dedication of the Temple. <hi>For thou, even thou only knoweſt the hearts of all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.39. So <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9. <hi>I the Lord ſearch the heart, and try the reins. Neither is
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:66159:86"/>
there any creature, that is not manifeſt in his ſight, but all things are naked and opened to the eyes of him, with whom we have to do,</hi> Heb. 4.13. For the ways of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his goings, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.21. Doth he not ſee my ways, and count all my ſteps, ſaith <hi>Job? Chap.</hi> 31.4. There is no darkneſs, nor ſhadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themſelves, <hi>Job</hi> 24.21, 22. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.9, 10, 11. He that planted the ear, ſhall he not hear? he that formed the eye, ſhall he not ſee? he that teacheth man knowledge, ſhall not he know? the Lord know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the thoughts of man that they are vanity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God is ſtiled a God hearing prayers, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.2. and this <hi>David</hi> could ſpeak experimentally; <hi>Verily, God hath heard me: he hath attended to the voice of my prayer: bleſſed be God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me,</hi> Pſal. 66.19, 20.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As he is a God hearing prayer, ſo he is moſt able to help, <hi>Pſal,</hi> 52.2. <hi>I will cry unto God moſt high: unto God that performeth all things for me He ſhall ſend from heaven and ſave me,</hi> Eph. 3.20. <hi>Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto him be glory in the Church by Chriſt Jeſus, throughout all ages world without end, Amen.</hi> So <hi>Aſa,</hi> when a mighty hoſt came againſt him, in his prayer, lays hold on Gods power and ability to help. <hi>Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it is nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us O Lord God, for we reſt on thee, and in thy name we go againſt this multitude,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14.11. So <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaphat,</hi> when a great multitude of the <hi>Moabites</hi> and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:66159:86"/>
                  <hi>Amonites</hi> came againſt him, he ſets himſelf to ſeek the Lord, as able and all-ſufficient to help him. And ſaid, <hi>O Lord God of our Fathers, art not thou God in heaven, and ruleſt not thou over all the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the Heathen? and in thine hand is there not power and might, ſo that none is able to withſtand thee? O our God, wilt not thou judge them? for we have no might againſt this great company that cometh againſt us, neither know we what to do, but our eyes are upon the?</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.6, 12.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Prayer is a Divine Worſhip and a Spiritual Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. God would have us to call upon him in the day of trouble, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.15. And if we ſhould be ſeeking help from any other, he will take it very ill at our hands. <hi>If we have forgotten the name of our God, or ſtretched out our hands to a ſtrange god</hi> (ſaith the Church) <hi>ſhall not God ſearch this out? for he knoweth the ſecrets of our hearts,</hi> Pſal. 44.20, 21. <hi>In every place Incenſe ſhall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering</hi> (ſaith the Lord.) Mal. 1.11. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.2. <hi>Let my prayer be ſet forth before thee as incenſe: and the lifting up of mine hands as an evening ſacrifice.</hi> There was given to the Angel that ſtood at the Altar, having a golden cenſer, much incenſe, <hi>That he ſhould offer it with the prayers of all Saints upon the golden Altar, which was before the throne of God. And the ſmoke of the incenſe, which came with the prayers of the Saints, aſcended up before God, out of the Angels hand,</hi> Rev. 8.3, 4. By this Angel, we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand Chriſt our Mediator, called the Angel or Meſſenger of the Covenant, or the Angel of Gods preſence, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.1. and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.9. who alone is the High Preiſt of Heaven, and offereth and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:66159:87"/>
our prayars with the incenſe of his merits and interceſſion upon the golden Altar, that is, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf, unto God, for a ſweet ſmelling ſavour, as is teſtified, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 14.14. See alſo <hi>Rev.</hi> 5:8.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In God onely we ought to beleive, therefore he onely is to be called upon. <hi>He that commeth to God muſt beleive that he is, &amp;c.</hi> Heb. 11.6. <hi>The ſame Lord who is ever all, is rich unto all that call upon him. For whoſoever ſhall call upon the name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Rom. 10.12, 13. Again, we are to pray unto God in the name of Chriſt, which is not rudely and cuſtomarily to ſay theſe words, <hi>Through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, &amp;c.</hi> but in confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the merits and interceſſion of Chriſt to call on God our heavenly Father: For ſince the fall of man none are called to come to God, or have promiſe to ſpeed, but in the name of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator. <hi>I am the way, the truth and the life,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>no man commeth to the Father but by me,</hi> Joh. 14.6. <hi>And there is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.15. <hi>John</hi> calls him the Advocate (he who pleads our cauſe) with the Father, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Wherefore he is able alſo to ſave them to the uttermoſt that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſſion for them,</hi> Heb. 7.25. In Chriſt alone we have acceſs to the throne of grace; Or as the Apoſtle expreſſeth it, <hi>Through him we haue an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs by one ſpirit unto the Father,</hi> Epheſ. 2.18. <hi>In whom we have boldneſs and acceſs with confidence by the faith of him,</hi> Eph. 3.12. And what ſaith Chriſt himſelf? <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall ask the Father in my name he will give it you,</hi> Joh. 16.23. So Col. 3.17.
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:66159:87"/>
                  <hi>Whatſoever ye do in word and deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jeſus, giving thanks to God, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by him.</hi> Angels or Saints departed do not, nor cannot preſent our prayers before God. Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>is ignorant of us,</hi> Iſa. 63.16. Chriſt onely is our Mediator and High Prieſt, who getteth an accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of our prayers before God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3.</p>
               <p>Again, We are to pray in the name of Chriſt through the ſpirit: <hi>Likewiſe the Spirit helpeth our infirmities, for we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought, but the Spirit it ſelf maketh interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. And he that ſearcheth the hearts, knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, becauſe he maketh interceſſion for the Saints according to the will of God,</hi> Rom. 8.26, 27. <hi>But ye beloved, building up your ſelves in your moſt holy faith, praying in the Holy ghoſt,</hi> Jude ver. 20. <hi>Praying always with all prayer and ſupplication in the ſpirit,</hi> Epheſ. 6.18. No praying aright but in and by the Spirit; <hi>God is a Spirit, and they that worſhip him muſt worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth,</hi> Joh. 4.14. And prayer ſurely is a principal part of his ſpiritual worſhip. Is it not ſad then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how carnal and formal worſhippers do deride and make a mock at the Spirit of God! O ſay they, you cannot pray, but by the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>So for Faith, that alſo is a neceſſary ingredient in prayer. <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of the prayer of faith that ſhall ſave the ſick, <hi>Jam</hi> 5.15. So alſo 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.22. And all things whatſoever ye ſhall ask in prayer, beleiving ye ſhall receive; Now this faith will work to the purifying of the heart. For if we regard iniquity in our hearts,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:66159:88"/>
God will not hear us, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 66.18. We haveing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gracious promiſes from God that he will grant our requeſts, that he will be very gracious unto us at the voyce of our cry, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.19. That when we call he will anſwer, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.9. and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us out of all our afflictions, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.19. We muſt come unto God, beleiving his word, for that he is true and faithful; as <hi>Sarah,</hi> who received ſtrength to conceive ſeed, and was delivered of a child, when ſhe was paſt age; becauſe ſhe judged him faithful who had promiſed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.11. But if hope to ſpeed does not accompany our prayers they are vain. Let not the doubting and wavering man think that he ſhall receive any thing of the Lord, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.6, 7. Yet know withal, that this hope ſometimes is very weak and feeble, and many times ſeems to be overwhelmed in the godly, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 13.1, 2.31.22. and 77.7, 8, 9.</p>
               <p>Again, As it muſt be a prayer of Faith, ſo it muſt be from the heart, with fervency of ſpirit. Prayer is not a lip labour, nor a formal devotion; but it is the ſighs and groans of a broken and peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent heart. <hi>Hanna</hi> ſpake in her heart when her voyce was not heard, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Moſes</hi> is ſaid to cry unto the Lord, when we find not one word that he uttered with his mouth, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.15. Hence is the exhortation that we be <hi>fervent in ſpirit, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Lord,</hi> Rom. 12.11. And it is ſaid, that the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth much, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16. As the things we beg are of more excellent uſe for us, ſo muſt we be more eager and importunate with the Lord for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them. I cried unto the Lord with my voice, with my voyce unto the Lord did I make my ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:66159:88"/>
I poured out my complaint before him. I ſhewed before him my trouble, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142.1, 2. This ſhewed the earneſtneſs and ferventneſs of his ſpirit in prayer. So <hi>Pſ.</hi> 80.1. Give ear, O ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> thou that dwelleſt between the cherubims, ſhine forth. Before <hi>Ephraim, Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> ſtir up thy ſtrength and come and ſave us: This ariſeth from the conſideration of the neceſſity and excellency of what we deſire, as alſo from a burning zeal of Gods glory, and hearty love of our brethren, in oppoſition to a ſpirit of hypocriſie, formality, ſluggiſhneſs and vain-bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; <hi>Thou ſhalt ariſe and have mercy upon Zion: For the time to favour her, yea, the ſet time is come.</hi> And what then? <hi>For</hi> Sions <hi>ſake I will not hold my peace, and for</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>ſake I will not reſt, until the righteouſneſs thereof go forth as brightneſs, and the ſalvation thereof as a lamp that burneth,</hi> Pſ. 102.13. com. with Iſa. 62.1.</p>
               <p>Again, when we pray, we muſt pray with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.15. Blind devotion is no way pleaſing to God. The ſoul without knowledge is not good, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.2. God will not be ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and ignorantly worſhipped, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.22, 23. The blind and the lame was not to come into the houſe of God. <hi>If ye offer the blind for ſacrifice, is it not evil? and if ye offer the lame and ſick, is it not evil? Offer it unto thy Governour, will he be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with thee, or accept thy perſon?</hi> Mal. 1.8. God requires to be ſerved with the mind, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.37. We muſt therefore know the will of God, as he hath revealed it unto us, by his commandments, promiſes, threatnings, the approved practices of the Saints, and that we muſt deſire and pray for, and onely ſo as we know Gods word doth warrant
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:66159:89"/>
us. <hi>This is the confidence that we have in him, that if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.14. <hi>And whatſoever we ask we receive of him, becauſe we keep his commandments, and do thoſe things that are pleaſing in his ſight,</hi> 1 John 3.22. So ſaid the blind man that had his ſight reſtored to him again; <hi>Now we know that God heareth not ſinners, but if any man be a worſhipper of God and doth his will, him he heareth,</hi> Joh. 9.31.</p>
               <p>Again, We muſt pray with a feeling of our wants. Chriſts invitation to come unto him, is to all that labour and are heavy laden, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28. In prayer we ſhould feel ſin as a burden, and mourn under the ſenſibility of our want of grace. So <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim</hi> bemoued himſelf, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18. And the Church, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.17. <hi>O Lord, why haſt thou made us to err from thy ways? and hardned our heart from thy fear? return for thy ſervants ſake, the Tribes of thine inheritance.</hi> So <hi>David</hi> being made very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of his great fall, after what manner is his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit led forth in prayer? <hi>Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right ſpirit within me. Caſt me not away from thy preſence, and take not thy holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit from me. Reſtore unto me the joy of thy ſalvation, and uphold me with thy free ſpirit,</hi> Pſal. 51.10, 11, 12. Now this ariſeth from the conſideration of Gods judgements due to ſin, and of the neceſſity of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving grace. So Ezra; <hi>O my God I am aſhamed, and bluſh to lift up my face to thee, my God, for our iniquities are encreaſed over our heads, and our treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs is grown up unto the heavens,</hi> Ez. 9.6. And the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles being ſenſible of the imbicility and weakneſs of their faith, pray unto the Lord for the increaſe of it. <hi>And for this thing,</hi> ſaid Paul, <hi>I beſought the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:66159:89"/>
Lord thrice that it might depart from me.</hi> So ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was he of the thorn in the fleſh, the meſſenger of Satan that buffeted him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7, 8.</p>
               <p>Again, our Prayer muſt be accompanied with a ſpirit of love and forgiveneſs, <hi>Mark</hi> 11.25. And when ye ſtand praying, forgive, if ye have ought againſt any man, <hi>that your Father alſo which is in Heaven, may forgive you your treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes: For if ye forgive men their treſpaſſes, your heavenly Father will alſo forgive you; But if ye forgive not men their treſpaſſes, neither will your father forgive your treſpaſſes,</hi> Mat. 6.14, 15. And as we muſt forgive our enemies, and ſuch as have offended us, ſo muſt we bear a hearty affection to the Children of God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.32. and <hi>Colloſ.</hi> 3.12, 13.</p>
               <p>Again, our Prayer muſt be accompanied with fear and reverence, in reſpect of the purity and Majeſty of that preſence we come into. So ſaith <hi>Solomon, Be not raſh with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be haſty to utter any thing before God; for God is in Heaven, and thou upon earth, therefore let thy words be few,</hi> Eccleſ. 5.2. And we are to ſerve God acceptably with reverence, and godly fear, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.28. Surely, did we ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider Gods moſt excellent Majeſty, we ſhould not raſhly conceive, or utter any thing before him, but with reverence. So <hi>Abraham, Behold ſaid he, I have now taken upon me to ſpeak unto the Lord, which am but duſt and aſhes,</hi> Gen. 18.27. This reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rential fear, is an unfeigned abaſement of the mind, proceeding from a conſideration of Gods divine Majeſty, and our own indignity. So the Prodigal, <hi>Father I have ſinned againſt Heaven,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:66159:90"/>
and in thy ſight, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son,</hi> Luk. 15.21. So <hi>Jacob, I am not worthy of the leaſt of all the mercies, and of all the truth which thou haſt ſhewed unto thy ſervant,</hi> Gen. 32.10. <hi>Job</hi> abhorred himſelf, and repented in duſt and aſhes, <hi>Job</hi> 42.6. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> cries out he is undone, woe unto him, for his eyes had ſeen the King, the Lord of Hoſts, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.5. and <hi>Ezra</hi> alſo, he did bluſh and was aſhamed to lift up his face to God, for that their iniquities were encreaſed, and their treſpaſſe grown up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heavens, <hi>Ezra.</hi> 9.6.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, our Prayer muſt be with perſeverance, without ceaſing, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.17. The Parable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the importunate Widow, was to this end, <hi>that men ought always to pray and not to faint,</hi> Luk. 18.1. That is, that we ſhould be conſtant and earneſt in prayer, uſe all importunity with the Lord, and not to faint; this is that which will diſtinguiſh us from being Hypocrites, and falſe-hearted before the Lord; For what is the hope of the Hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his ſoul? will God hear his cry when trouble commeth upon him? Will he delight himſelf in the Almighty? will he always call upon God? No, he will not, <hi>Job</hi> 27.8, 9, 10. But the gracious ſoul loves to draw nigh to God, and takes delight always in his approaching to him.</p>
               <p>Thus having ſpoken of the ſeveral ingredients that will make up an acceptable Prayer unto the Lord; I ſhall ſpeak a little as to the ſingular worth excellency, and efficacy of it; and the worth and excellency of it appears in this: Becauſe, it
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:66159:90"/>
is a ſweet priviledge which Chriſt hath purchaſed of the Father for us, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.18. It is through him that we have an acceſs unto the Father, ſo as to come with boldneſs unto the throne of his grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16. Hereby we do and may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually commune with the Lord after a familiar manner, and lay open our griefs into his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</p>
               <p>As <hi>David, Who am I O Lord God, and what is my houſe, that thou haſt brought me hitherto? And is this the manner of man O Lord God?</hi> 2 Sam. 7.18. So again, <hi>From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed; lead me to the Rock that is higher then I, for thou haſt been a ſhelter for me, and a ſtrong Tower from the enemy,</hi> Pſa. 61.2, 3. Hereby we teſtifie our duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful affection to him, as the Prodigal to his Father, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.18. And become helpers to others, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.30. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.19. <hi>Col.</hi> 4.12. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.1. This adds ſtrength to our faith, and gives life to the graces of God that are in us. By it we obtain at the hand of God whatever good we ſtand in need of, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.7. Iſa. 65.24. And do grow into a better acquaintance with God. As <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> Gen. 18.23, 27. For ſuch is the Promiſe, that if we draw nigh to God, he will draw nigh to us, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.8. By it we fight manfully againſt our in bred unmortified corruptions, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.18. By it Croſſes are prevented, removed, or ſanctified, yea, all things are ſanctified unto us, and we are ſo kept and preſerved, that we fall not into temptation, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.41. Yea, often times we obtain much more good then we deſire or expect. <hi>Solomon</hi> begged onely of the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:66159:91"/>
Lord, an underſtanding heart, and God gave him both riches, and honour, which he asked not, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 3.13. So able is the Lord to do exceeding abundantly above all that we can ask or think, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.20. So that of Prayer, we may ſay, it is a Key to open the door of Gods treaſure houſe, a preſent remedy for an oppreſſed mind, a giver of ſtrengh to the weak, and an eſpecial means to make a man fit to live knowingly, fruitfully, and ſerviceably to God in every ſtate and condition, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.9, 10. What ſhall I ſay of it? but as one ſaith well and truly; It is, <hi>Conſolatio flentium, cura dolentium, &amp; ſanitas aegrotoraem.</hi> A Comfort for them that mourn, the joy of the ſorrowful, and health for thoſe that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

Yea, it doth as it were, bind up the hands of the Lord, and hinder him from executing his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, overcoming him that overcometh all things, <hi>Let me alone,</hi> ſaith the Lord to <hi>Moſes, or ſuffer me that my wrath may wax hot againſt them,</hi> (to wit) the <hi>Iſraelites, that I may conſume them,</hi> Exod. 32.10. <hi>Abrahams</hi> prayer had ſaved <hi>Sodom</hi> from being deſtroyed, had there been found ten righteous perſons therein, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. Yea, it is very obſervable, that the Lord did not leave granting, till <hi>Abraham</hi> left off petitioning. By prayer <hi>Jacob</hi> was delivered from the wrath and fury of his Brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> Gen. 32.11. <hi>Jonah</hi> out of the Fiſhes belly, <hi>Jonah</hi> 2.10. The three
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:66159:91"/>
Children from the fiery Furnace; <hi>Daniel</hi> from the Lions Den, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Jonahs,</hi> and <hi>Pauls</hi> Mariners from the danger of the Seas; and <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> and others out of Priſon, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.16. By Prayer <hi>Eliah</hi> ſtayed the Rain three years and ſix months, and again obtained Rain, ſo that the earth yeilded her fruit, <hi>James</hi> 5.17. By Prayer <hi>Eliſha</hi> had the ſpirit of <hi>Eliah</hi> doubled upon him, and procured Bears to deſtroy the mocking Children, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2. raiſed from death to life the <hi>Shuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi> Son, So Chap. 4. Had the eyes of his Servant opened, ſo that he ſaw Mountains full of Horſes, and Chariots of fire round about him, and ſmote the <hi>Syrians</hi> with blindneſs, which came to take him, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. By Prayer <hi>Joſhua</hi> commanded the Sun to ſtand ſtill in the midſt of Heaven, until the people had avenged themſelves upon their enemies, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 10.12, 13. By Prayer <hi>Iſaiah</hi> brought back the Sun ten degrees in the Dial of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 20 11. By Prayer <hi>David</hi> fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated the wicked counſel of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> and often put his enemies to flight, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.31. <hi>and</hi> 16.23. and <hi>Pſa.</hi> 56.9. by Prayer <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was delivered from the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and his health reſtored unto him again, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 37. and 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18. The <hi>Ninevites</hi> were delivered from the judgements threatned againſt them, <hi>Jonah</hi> 2. <hi>Peter</hi> raiſed <hi>Tabitha,</hi> and <hi>Paul Eutichus,</hi> that had fallen down by ſleeping, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.40. <hi>and</hi> 20.10. The <hi>Cent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:66159:92"/>
were clenſed, and certain perſons being dead, were reſtored to life again. So much availeth Prayer with the Lord, if it be ſervent. But to bring it a little more cloſe as to the preſent viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lord; See of what force and efficacy it hath been with the Lord to appeaſe his wrath, and ſtay the execution of his judgments. When the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> fell a murmuring, and had greatly provoked the Lord by their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, inſomuch that, the Lord threatned to ſmite them with Peſtilence, and diſinherit them; <hi>Moſes</hi> falls a pleading and interceeding with the Lord for them. Pardon I beſeech thee, the iniquity of this people, according unto the greatneſs of thy mercy, and as thou haſt forgiven this people from <hi>Egypt,</hi> even until now. <hi>And the Lord ſaid, I have pardoned according to thy word,</hi> Numb. 14.12, 19, 20. So that only <hi>thoſe men who brought up the evil report upon the land, dyed by the Plague before the Lord,</hi> verſ. 37. So in the caſe of <hi>Korah Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> when the Congregation of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> murmured againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> ſaying, <hi>they killed the people of the Lord,</hi> This ſo greatly incenſed the Lord, that he bad them <hi>go up from the congregation, that he might conſume them in a moment;</hi> Hereupon the Text ſaies, <hi>they fell upon their faces, and</hi> Aaron <hi>according to the command of</hi> Moſes, <hi>takes his Cenſer and puts fire therein, from off the Alter, and put on Incenſe, and made an attonement for the people, for there was wrath gone out from the Lord, the Plague was begun. And</hi> Aaron <hi>ſtood between the dead and the living, and the Plague was ſtaid,</hi> Numb. 16, 45, 46, 47. This ſheweth how
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:66159:92"/>
greatly the Prayers and actions of Gods Servants do prevail with him, when they are faithful, fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, and according to his will, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.14. and foreſhewed alſo the power and efficacy of Chriſts meditation for poor ſinners, who is repreſented by the Angels ſtanding at the Altar, <hi>having a golden Cenſer, and much Incenſe given unto him, to offer it with the prayers of all Saints,</hi> Rev. 8.3.</p>
               <p>For God heareth him always, <hi>John</hi> 11.40. And he it is that makes interceſſion for the tranſgreſſors, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.12. and is the attonement or propitiation for our ſins, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.1. and for his ſake God before whom the Peſtilence goeth, in wrath remembreth mercy, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.2, 5. And as the blood of the Paſchal Lamb (figuring the blood of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7.) ſtayed the Angel which deſtroyed the <hi>Egyptians</hi> from touching the <hi>Iſraelites, Exod.</hi> 12.23. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.28. So the ſmoke of <hi>Aarons</hi> incenſe (figuring the medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 141.2. <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.4. Stayed the Plague here from the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> which ſurvived. That as it is written of the Peſtilence in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> time, <hi>The Lord repented him of the evil, and ſaid to the Angel that deſtroyed the people; It is enough, ſtay now thy hand,</hi> 2 Sam. 24.16. So in this verſe, the further efficacy and effect of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful fervent prayer, for the removal of this ſore vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation of the Lord, is clearly held forth in that Prayer of <hi>Solomon</hi> at the Temples dedication; <hi>If there be in the Land Famine, if there be Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, whatſoever Plague, whatſoever Sickneſs there be, what Prayer and Supplication ſoever be made by any man, or by all thy people</hi> Iſrael,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:66159:93"/>
                  <hi>which ſhall know every man the plague of his own heart, and ſpread forth his hands towards this houſe. Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, and do,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.37, 38, 39. And the Lord gave approbation to this prayer of his, as you have heard. Thus you ſee in what way the Lord hath uſually been found for the diverting of his judgments, and in which he hath ingaged himſelf to hear, and to be entreated.</p>
               <p>Shall we conſider a little then, what is the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſpirit of the Nation at this time; now that the hand of God lies ſo heavy upon it. Is there any preparation now of meeting God, in this way of humble and faithful ſupplication? O <hi>England</hi> where are thy tears, where are thy ſtrong crys unto unto the Lord? Will not the King of <hi>Nineveh</hi> riſe up in judgment againſt thee, and condemn thee? He commanded that Man and Beaſt ſhould be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with ſackcloth, and cry mightily unto God, and turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that was in their hand; and God was entreated, and turned away from his fierce an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that they periſhed not.</p>
               <p>What thinkeſt thou, O <hi>England,</hi> of thy ſins? Have they not been crying ſins? May not the Lord ſpeak unto thee, and ſay, as unto <hi>Cain; Who ſlew his Brother, what haſt thou done? The voice of thy Brothers blood cryeth unto me from the ground,</hi> Gen. 4.10. Or as <hi>James</hi> in his time, to the rich ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men of that generation: <hi>Behold the hire of the Labourers, which have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, cryeth, and the cries of them which have reaped, are entred into the ears of the Lord of Sabboth. Ye have lived in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:66159:93"/>
on the earth, and been wanton: ye have nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your hearts as in a day of ſlaughter: Ye have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and killed the juſt, and be doth not reſiſt you,</hi> James 5.4, 5, 6.</p>
               <p>May it not be ſaid of thy ſins, as is ſaid of the ſins of <hi>Babylon, That her ſins have reached unto hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and God hath remembred her iniquities,</hi> Rev. 18.5. Surely thy ſins have been crying ſins, they have entred into the ears of the Lord, they have reached unto heaven: God hath heard thy hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Oaths, thy new helliſh invented Oaths, thy horrid execrations and curſings, thy revilings and blaſpemings. But whom haſt thou reproached and blaſphemed? and againſt whom haſt thou exalted thy voice? and lifted up thine eyes on high? may it not be ſaid of thee, as of railing <hi>Rabſhekah; Even againſt the holy one of</hi> Iſrael? And if thy ſins have cryed ſo loud, mayſt thou not think that thy tears and crys for pardon ſhould found as loud in the ears of God?</p>
               <p>But where are thy repentings and mournings? where are thy weepings and ſupplications? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I tremble to think, what ſtill mine ears do hear and mine eyes ſee, how few of thoſe ſins are left, which cauſe the Land to mourn, and the Lord to have a controverſie with the inhabitants thereof. May it not be laid to thy charge, even now when thouſands are ſwept away by this deſtroying judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that when God calls to weeping and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to faſting and praying; behold, joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſlaying oxen and killing ſheep, eating fleſh and drinking wine, playing and gaming, ranting and roaring, curſing and ſwearing, pride and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous living? And what ſaid the Lord? <hi>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:66159:94"/>
this iniquity ſhall not be purged from you, till ye dye,</hi> Iſa. 22.12, 13, 14. Nay, is it not moſt ſad and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable to conſider, as it is very credibly reported, that ſome under the hand of Gods viſitation, do dye ſwearing and curſing, in a moſt dreadful and deſperate manner.</p>
               <p>Well then, conſider this ye that forget God, leſt he tear you in peices, and there be none to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver, before the whole land be devoured by the fire of his jealouſie, and that he make a ſpeedy riddance of all ſuch as dwell in the land. But for you, who have received an anointing from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one, and are acquainted with the divine art of prayer, and holy conference and familiarity with God; be much in the exerciſe of this heavenly skill, be now improving to the utmoſt your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in God; lift up your voice with ſtrength, ſtir up your ſelves and take hold of him. And if your conſciences tell you, you have fallen by your iniquities, even in the late Apoſtacy. <hi>Take with you words, and turn unto the Lord, ſay unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciouſly.</hi> Say unto him, Aſhur <hi>ſhall not ſave us, we will not ride upon horſes, neither will we ſay any more to the work of our hands, ye are our gods,</hi> Hoſea 14.1, 2, 3. Say unto him, O Lord, though our iniquities teſtifie againſt us, do thou it for thy names ſake, for our back-ſlidings are many, we have ſinned againſt thee. O the hope of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Saviour thereof in time of trouble, why ſhouldſt thou be as a ſtranger in the land, and as a wayfaring man, that turneth aſide to tarry for a night? Why ſhouldſt thou be as a man aſtoniſhed, as a mighty man that cannot ſave? yet thou, O Lord, art in the midſt of
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:66159:94"/>
us, and we are called by thy name, leave us not, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.7, 8, 9. Say, <hi>We are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteouſneſs are as filthy raggs, and we all do fade as a leaf, and our iniquities like the wind have taken us away; But yet, O Lord, thou art our Father: we are the clay, and thou our potter, and we all are the work of thy hand. Be not wroth very ſore, O Lord, neither remember iniquity for ever: behold, ſee we beſeech thee, we are thy people,</hi> Iſa. 64.6, 8, 9. <hi>Thine enemies roar in the midſt of the Congregation, they ſet up their enſigns for ſigns: They have eaſt fire into thy Sanctuary, they have defiled, by caſting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground. They ſaid in their hearts, let us deſtroy them together: O God, how long ſhall the Adverſary reproach? ſhall the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my blaſpheme thy name for ever? Why withdraweſt thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it out of thy boſome. Wilt thou refrain thy ſelf for theſe things, O Lord? wilt thou hold thy peace, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict us very ſore,</hi> Pſal. 74. <hi>And let the Preiſts, the Miniſters of the Lord weep between the Porch and the Altar, and let them ſay, Spare thy people, O Lord, and give not thy heritage to reproach, that the heathen ſhould rule over them: wherefore ſhould they ſay among the people, Where is their God? Then will the Lord be jealous for his land, and pity his people,</hi> Joel 2.17, 18. Yea, let the Lords Watchmen, whom God hath ſet upon the Walls of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> never hold their peace day nor night; even thoſe who make mention of the Lord, and are the Lords remembrancers, let them not keep ſilence. <hi>And give him no reſt, till he eſtabliſh and make his Jeruſalem a praiſe in the earth,</hi> Iſa. 62.6, 7. Till the heavens drop down from above, and the skies

Thus much for the fourth ſoveraign Receipt.</p>

               <head>The Fifth Spiritual Receipt.</head>
               <p n="5">5ly. The next Spiritual Receipt, and eſpecial preſervative againſt this Peſtilential ſickneſs, which I ſhall recommend unto thee, is this. <hi>Have thy dwelling now in the ſecret place of the moſt high,</hi> Pſal. 91.1. or as it is further expreſt in the 9. <hi>ver.</hi> of the ſame Pſalm, <hi>Make the Lord thy refuge, even the moſt high thy habitation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In Peſtilential and contagious times, and when the ſickneſs comes near to our own houſes, moſt men and womens thoughss are buſied about their habitations and dwellings; where they ſhall remove and have their beings, ſo as they think they may be moſt ſafe and ſecure from the ſtroke of Gods Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and therefore they will chuſe (eſpecially ſuch as are more able and wealthy) the beſt coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where is the beſt aire, and moſt healthful ſoil, and the beſt company, and food, and ſuch other accommodations, as may probably conduce to the keeping of themſelves in a ſound and healthful conſtitution. In ſome caſes ſuch proviſions as theſe may be neceſſary, expedient, and lawful. And therefore it is upon my heart now to direct thee where thou mayſt take up a moſt ſecure and ſafe habitation, and that is in God, in the ſecret place of the moſt high, under the ſhadow of the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:66159:95"/>
Almighty; and let me tell thee, whoever thou art that ſeekeſt ſecurity and protection elſewhere, and takeſt not up thy dwelling in God, thou wilt be fruſtrated in thy expectation. <hi>Shouldſt thou hid thy ſelf in the top of</hi> Carmel, <hi>Amos</hi> 9.3. <hi>Or take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermoſt parts of the ſea,</hi> Pſal. 139.9. even there his hand will find thee out, and the ſtroke of his indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will light upon thee. The only way then to ſecure thy ſelf, is not to be flying from, but to be flying unto God; to be living and dwelling in God. God as he is a ſecret place, ſo he is a ſecure place. Every man would be there (eſpecially in times of danger) where he may be moſt ſecret and ſecure. But what may we underſtand by making God our habitation, or by dwelling in the ſecret place of the moſt high. The words are very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive, and of a large extent, but I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them under ſome following heads; after I have toucht a little by way of explanation, or opening of them.</p>
               <p>By the ſecret place of the moſt high, we may underſtand Heaven, the ſeat and throne of God, which the Scripture holds forth under theſe three denominations or expreſſions.</p>
               <p>To wit, <hi>His high place, his holy place, his ſecret place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His high place,</hi> Pſal. 93.4. <hi>The Lord on high is mightier then the noiſe of many waters,</hi> Pſal. 97.9. <hi>Thou Lord art high above all the earth, above all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> Pſal. 99.2. The Lord is high above all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and his glory above the heavens, <hi>Who is like unto the Lord our God, who dwelleth on high,</hi> Pſal. 113.5. heaven is a high place.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:66159:96"/>So it is his <hi>Holy place,</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46.4. they are joyned both together: <hi>The River, the ſtreams whereof make glad the City of God;</hi> is ſaid to be, <hi>the holy place of the tabernacles of the moſt high.</hi> So in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.15. <hi>Thus ſaith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity, whoſe name is holy;</hi> And mark what follows? <hi>I dwell in the high and holy place, with him alſo that is of a contrite and humble ſpirit,</hi> &amp;c. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.5. <hi>A Father of the fatherleſs, and a Judge of the widows, is God in his holy babita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that is, in heaven his holy habitation, or the habitation of his holineſs, and of his glory, as it is termed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.15.</p>
               <p>So here it is called his <hi>Secret place,</hi> the ſecret place of the moſt high; and heaven may very fitly be called Gods ſecret place, as well as his high and holy place; becauſe God and Chriſt, and the things of heaven and eternity, they are ſecret, hidden, and myſterious things. <hi>Great is the myſtery of godlineſs,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. So in <hi>Col.</hi> 1.26. The Apoſtle calls it, <hi>The myſtery hid from ages and generations, but now</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is made manifeſt to his Saints;</hi> and the Saints themſelves they have hut an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſight of God. We ſee but his back part, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.23. but as through a glaſs darkly; <hi>We know but in part, but when that which is perfect is come, then that which is imperfect ſhall be done away,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9, 10, 12. Hence it is, that God is ſaid, <hi>To dwell in that light which no man can approach unto, whom no man hath ſeen, or can ſee,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Jeſus Chriſt may be ſaid to be Gods <hi>Secret place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. In that he is ſaid as before, <hi>To be the myſtery, which was kept ſecret ſince the world began,</hi> Rom. 16.25.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:66159:96"/>2. In reſpect of that incomprehenſible union that is betwixt the Father, and the Son, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.21.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe the declaration or revelation of the Father is from Chriſt, <hi>who is in the boſome of the Father,</hi> Joh. 1.18. and thats a Secret place. And the Apoſtle ſpeaks of a life that is hid with God in Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.3.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In reſpect of Chriſts eternity with the Father. <hi>The Lord poſſeſſing him in the beginning of his way, before his works of old. Then was Chriſt by him, as one brought up with him,</hi> Prov. 8.22, 30.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Chriſt himſelf is ſaid to be, <hi>A hidding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempeſt,</hi> Iſa. 32.2.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Church (which was figured by the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle) may be ſaid to be Gods Secret place, his dwelling place. <hi>God hath deſired it for his habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; This</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is my reſt for ever, here will I dwell, for I have deſired it,</hi> Pſal. 132.13, 14. To which purpoſe is that in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.5. where we read of the ſecret of his tabernacle, <hi>In the ſecret of his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle ſhall he hide me;</hi> which hath reference to the Sanctuary or Ark, the place of Gods abode or viſible preſence, ſo to be hid in his pavilion, the Prophet declares the aſſurance he had, being ſhroud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under Gods protectio;n hide me or keep me ſafe, as in the moſt holy place of thy Sanctuary, <hi>Where none might enter, but the High Preiſt, and that alone, once every year, and not without blood neither, which he offered for htmſelf, and for the errors of the people;</hi> Heb. 9.7. And this is called Gods ſecret or hidden place, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7.22. As his Saints are called his hidden ones, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 83.3. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.20. <hi>Thou ſhalt hide them in the ſecret of thy preſence,</hi> or thou hideſt them in the hiding place of thy preſence, where thou always looks unto
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:66159:97"/>
them, in ſecret favour, which the world knoweth not of. So then to dwell in the ſecret place of the moſt high, is to dwell in God, in Heaven, in Chriſt, in his Church, to have a converſation with God in the heavens; As the Apoſtle expreſſeth it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. For our converſation is in Heaven; To have our affections on things above, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.2. to live a life of fellowſhip and communion with God, as the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> expreſſeth it, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3.</p>
               <p>Again, To make God our habitation, includes theſe four or five particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A mans habitation is the place of his conſtant reſidence and abode.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is the place of his ſafety, ſecurity, and ſtrength.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is the place of his ſecrecy.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is the place of his recreation, delectation, or delight.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is the chief place of his negotiation, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and converſe.</p>
               <p>Under theſe five heads, or ſeveral ſences, may we underſtand our dwelling in God, or making God our habitation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then the place of a mans dwelling, is the place of his conſtant reſidence or abode. When we would ſpeak with a man, we enquire where he dwells, where his habitation is, for there we ſuppoſe he is reſident; So then, if thou dwelleſt in God, if God is thy habitation, thou wilt have thy conſtant abode with him, thy reſidence with him; this holds forth a fixed ſtation or habitation in and with God. Thou wilt not be as a ſtranger in a forreign Land, and as a wayfaring man, that turneth aſide to tarry for a night, as <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:66159:97"/>
it, <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.8. Thou wilt not take up a nights lodging with him, and then away, and be gone, as Travellers and wayfaring men uſe to do, but thou wilt abide with him, ſet up thy dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with him; many will out of a complement, now and then go and give a Friend or an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance a viſit: or for diverſions ſake, being tired it may be in their Shops, through multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of buſineſs, and their worldly negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they are willing to take a little recreation, when they can beſt diſpence with it. Even ſo do many deal with God, they will give him, it may be, a complemental viſit now and then; Some, they will go to Church now and then, and hear Divine Service (as they call it) or it may be if they hear where an able powerful man Preacheth, they will perhaps out of a humour, or ſome itching deſire, go and hear him; And others they will give God a viſit now and then, if it be but to ſtop the mouth of conſcience, they will pray now and then, and hear now and then, when their worldly occaſions will give them leave, they will be ſerving God when they know not how to ſerve themſelves. Nay, it may be, they will go a ſtrain higher, and expreſs ſome kind of delight in what they do, it ſhall be ſome kind of recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation unto them now, and then to come among the aſſemblies of Gods Saints, like thoſe whom the Lord reproves in the Prophet <hi>Ezekiels</hi> time, forward hearers they were, they ſpake one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, every one to his Brother, ſaying, <hi>Come I pray you, and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the Lord; And</hi> (ſaies the Lord) <hi>they come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee as the people cometh, and they ſit before thee</hi>

                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:66159:98"/>
                  <hi>as my people, and they bear thy words, but they will not do them; for with their mouth they ſhew much love, but their heart goeth after their cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs. And lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely ſong of one that hath a pleaſant voice, and can play well on an inſtrument; for they hear thy words, but they do them not,</hi> Ezek. 33.30, 31, 32. O he's a gallant man, a learned man, ſay they, how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently did he ſpeak? even like a lovely ſong, that ſoundeth pleaſantly. So is it ſaid of <hi>Herod,</hi> that he heard <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and obſerved him; yea, did many things, and heard him gladly, yet rather then he will part with his <hi>Herodias,</hi> his darling ſin, off muſt go his head, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.20. But this is not to dwell with God. Some people they have their fits in Religion, they will be ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly devout now and then, and eſpecially if their religion ſwims along with the times, and is in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, and a ſtep to worldly preferment, ſo long they will follow Chriſt; but theſe not having root in themſelves, endure but for a while; for when tribulation or perſecution ariſeth, becauſe of the word, by and by they are offended, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.21. See then that thou haſt thy dwelling, in God thy fixt habitation and abode in God. So had the Church in <hi>Pſa.</hi> 90.1, 2. <hi>Lord, Thou haſt been our dwelling place in all generations; Before the Mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadſt formed the earth; even from everlaſting to everlaſting, thou art God.</hi> This Pſalm is ſaid to be a Prayer of <hi>Moſes</hi> the man of God, in which <hi>Moſes</hi> does acknowledge the Lord to be their dwelling place, their habitation or manſion-houſe, or place of retreat in all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, in all their travails through the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:66159:98"/>
Wilderneſs, wherein God lead them; God was a refuge unto them in their greateſt ſtreights, and troubles at all times; He had promiſed that his preſence ſhould go with him, and that he would give him reſt, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.14. and <hi>Moſes</hi> did experience the truth of it. And therefore in <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.26, 27. It is ſaid, <hi>There is none like unto the God of</hi> Jeſuran, <hi>who rideth upon the heavens for thy help, and in his excellency on the skie; The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlaſting armes;</hi> So in the 29. <hi>verſe. Happy art thou, O</hi> Iſrael; <hi>Who is like unto thee, O people, ſaved by the Lord, the ſhield of thy help, and who is the Sword of thy excellency, and thine enemies ſhall be found liers unto thee, and thou ſhalt tread upon their high places;</hi> And then indeed mayſt thou be ſaid to dwell in God, to have a conſtant abode with him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When (as <hi>David</hi>) thou art continually with him, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 73.23. and ſet'ſt the Lord allways be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 16.8. This will awe us when we have opportunities and temptations to ſecret ſins, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.9. This will poſſeſs us with more reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and godly fear in duties of his worſhip and ſervice, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.10. This will provoke us to diligence in every good work. The eye of the Maſter makes a diligent Servant, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.22. This will comfort us in our afflictions, and encourage us againſt fears; If we walk through the Valley of the ſhadow of death, we ſhall fear no evil, if the Lord is with us, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 23.4. And he will be with us while we be with him, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.2. If we ſet the Lord always before us, we ſhall not be moved, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 16.8. <hi>Moſes</hi> endured, as ſeeing
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:66159:99"/>
him who is inviſible, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.27.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Then mayſt thou be ſaid to dwell in God, and make him thy habitation and conſtant place of abode, when thou makeſt him thy chiefeſt good, when thou choſeſt him as thy portion, and chief happineſs, and liveſt wholly upon him as thy All in all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.36. When his name and glory is firſt inſcribed on thy heart, chiefly in thine eye, and principally as thine end and aim, in all thy actions and undertakings, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. When thou canſt ſay with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee, and there is none upon earth that I deſire beſides thee: My fleſh and my heart faileth; but God is the ſtrength of my heart and my portion for ever,</hi> Pſa. 73.26. Then wilt thou not know, nor deſire, nor love any creature, but purely, as ſubordinate to God. If this were but ſetled in our hearts, how would it ballaſt them, and keep them ſteddy, that they would not be toſſed up and down with the various occurrences of this life, neither lift up with Proſperity, nor caſt down with adverſity, for whether we have more of theſe things, they make no conſiderable addition to us; God is our happineſs, and not the creature; or whether we have leſs of theſe things, it is no diminution to our happineſs; we ſtill have our portion: We are but as a man that hath turned his eſtate into money, though he hath not houſes, nor lands, nor flocks, nor herds; yet he hath that which <hi>anſwers all things,</hi> Eccleſ. 10.19. So it is with one that hath God for his portion, whoſe is the earth and the fulneſs thereof; He can with <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> rejoyce in God, in the deprevation and abſence of all other things, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.17, 18.
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:66159:99"/>
And ſay with <hi>Paul, As ſorrowful, yet alway re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, yet poſſeſſing all things;</hi> 2 Cor. 6.10. Give twenty pounds to a poor man, and you make him; take ſo much from him, and you undoe him; but it is nothing in a rich mans Purſe, that hath thouſands coming in yearly; Let an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiver looſe the World, and he looſeth all; he complains with <hi>Laban</hi> that his gods are gone, let him have theſe things in abundance, and he is tranſported like <hi>Haman,</hi> but theſe are ſmall things with him, <hi>whoſe portion is the Lord;</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore call nothing <hi>proſperity or pleaſure,</hi> but his love, and nothing <hi>adverſity or miſery</hi> but his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure. When any thing would ſeem lovely and deſireable which is againſt him, call it Dung; And hear that man, as Satan or the Serpent, that would entiſe thee from him; and count him but vanity, a worm and duſt, that would affright thee from thy duty to him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Then mayſt thou be ſaid to dwell in God, to have thy conſtant abode with him; When thou ſhalt prize all opportunities of communion with God in his Ordinances; as Prayer, Reading, and Hearing, the Word of God. So <hi>David, As the Hart panteth after the water-brooks, ſo panteth my ſoul after thee O God,</hi> Pſa. 42.1. <hi>O God thou art my God, early will I ſeek thee; my ſoul thirſteth for thee, my fleſh longeth for thee, in a dry and thirſty land, where no water is. To ſee thy power and thy glory, ſo as I have ſeen thee in the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> Pſa. 63.1, 2. <hi>and</hi> 84.1, 2. <hi>How amiable are thy Tabernacles O Lord of Hoſts? my ſoul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the Courts of the Lord; my
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:66159:100"/>
heart and my fleſh cryeth out for the living God.</hi> So Pſal. 122.1. <hi>I was glad when they ſaid unto me; let us go into the Houſe of the Lord.</hi> This to do is our Duty, and our Priviledge.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is our Duty, and part of that homage which we owe to God, as our Lord and Lawgiver, by prayer to acknowledge our dependance on him, Pſal. 65.2. and our ſubjection to him, by ſitting down at his feet, to receive the Law from his mouth, to take our inſtructions from him, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is our Priviledge, which coſt two of the greateſt gifts which heaven could afford, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.17. the Son of God, that we might have acceptance; The Spirit of God, that we might have aſſiſtance. What greater priviledge are we capable of? then at any time to go and reveal our cauſe to God, and to pour out our complaints before him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 20.12. To have leave to beg any thing of him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.13. To ask Counſel of him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.24. There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our communion with God a transfuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſpirits, the Lord communicating his Spirit or Divine Nature to us therein, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides our own preſſing neceſſities, which ſhould daily provoke us hereto. And the oftner we come to God, the more welcome ſhall we be, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.14. and the more boldneſs, and liberty, of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs we ſhall have; diſ-uſe and in-frequency, breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſtrangneſs betwixt God and the Soul, and deading the heart to communion with him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Mans Houſe is the place of his ſafety, ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and ſtrength: We uſe to ſay, a mans Houſe is his Caſtle; then we make God our habitation, when we make him our refuge and our ſtrength.
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:66159:100"/>
So did <hi>David, I will love thee, O Lord, my ſtrength The Lord is my rock, and my fortreſs, and my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer: my God, my ſtrength in whom I will truſt, my buckler, the horn of my ſalvation, and my high tower,</hi> Pſal. 18.2. God was his ſtrength, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender in all adverſities; God was his rock, where he fled for refuge, when hunted and purſued by his enemies, his fortreſs or ſtrong hold, wherein he was ſafely kept and preſerved; his ſheild to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadow and defend him. The horn of his ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is, the ſtrength of his deliverance, and the high tower or ſtrong tower of his protection, wherein to his righteous ſoul did run and was ſafe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.10. In the 61. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. <hi>and</hi> 3. <hi>David</hi> prayeth, <hi>That God would lead him to the rock, that was higher then he. For thou haſt been a ſhelter for me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and a ſtrong tower from the enemy.</hi> So in the <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.3. <hi>Be thou my ſtrong habitation, whereunto I may continually reſort.</hi> Be thou to me for a rock of habitation, where I may continually fly unto in all my difficulties and diſtreſſes. See alſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.2. With what confidence in God was the Chuch carried forth upon this account; <hi>God is our refuge and ſtrength, a very preſent help in trouble. Therefore will not we fear, though the earth he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and though the mountains be carried into the midſt of the ſea. Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains ſhake with the ſwelling thereof,</hi> Pſal. 46.1, 2, 3. By the changing of the earth, and removing of mountains, are often meant the alteration of States and Polities, <hi>Hagg.</hi> 2.21, 22. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 51.25. <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.14. By which we are given to underſtand, That in the time of the greateſt mutations and revolutions in
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:66159:101"/>
time of the greateſt toffings and tumblings, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and over-turnings, the Church would not be diſmayed, but confidently expect deliverance from God.</p>
               <p>Well then, if thou wilt make God thy habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thy place of ſecurity and ſtrength, thy rock and thy fortreſs; Thou wilt make him thy only rock, thy only ſtay and truſt; thou wilt ſeek help and deliverance in all thy ſtreights and trouble from him, and from him only. <hi>He only</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>is my rock and my ſalvation, he is my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, I ſhall not be moved.</hi> And from hence it is that he encourages his ſoul, <hi>To waite only upon God,</hi> telling us that his expectation was from him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.6, 7. Nor would he truſt in his Bow, nor on his Sword to ſave him. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.6.</p>
               <p>Now then doſt thou make God thy only rock, thy only refuge? Doſt thou flye unto him in all thy ſtreights, and to him only? or haſt thou recourſe to ſome other rock? to ſome other refuſe? Take heed of truſting in man and making fleſh thine arm: There's a curſe denounced againſt ſuch, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.5. Doſt thou go down into <hi>Egypt,</hi> to ſtrengthen thy ſelf in the ſtrength of <hi>Pharaoh?</hi> know then, that thou truſteſt but upon a broken ſtaff, and a bruiſed reed, as <hi>Rabſhekeh</hi> ſaid to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.21. even in a ſhadow. And that the ſtrength of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſhall be thy ſhame, and the truſt in the ſhadow of <hi>Egypt</hi> thy confuſion, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.2, 3. Doſt thou put thy truſt in Princes, or in the Sons of Men? know that thou truſts but in a ſhadow likewiſe, <hi>Judg.</hi> 9.15. and that there is no help in them; their breath goeth forth, they return to their earth, in that very day their thoughts pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,

                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46.3, 4. <hi>And that its better to truſt in the Lord, then to put confidence in man; yea, then to put confidence in Princes,</hi> Pſal. 118.8, 9. Doſt thou truſt in graven Images, and ſay to the molten Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res; ye are our gods? know thou ſhalt be turned back, and be greatly aſhamed, yea, confounded, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.17. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.7. Is thy truſt ſuch as is the hope of hypocrites? know that the hypocrites hope ſhall periſh and be cut off, and his truſt ſhall be as a ſpiders web, <hi>Job</hi> 8.14. Doſt thou make gold thy hope, and ſay to the fine gold, thou art my confidence? truſting in the abundance of thy wealth, and ſtrengthening thy ſelf in thy wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs: know that this is an iniquity to be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Judge, for that thou denieſt God that is above, <hi>Job</hi> 31.24, 28. Yea, further know, <hi>That God ſhall deſtroy thee for ever, and take thee away, and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place, and root thee out of the land of the living. And the righteous ſhall ſee, and fear, and laugh at thee</hi> (and ſay) <hi>Lo this is the Man that made not God his ſtrength,</hi> Pſal. 52.5, 6, 7. Doſt thou truſt in thine own beauty, and play the harlot, and pour out thy fornications? know that God will judge thee, as women that break wedlock, and ſhed blood are judged, and will give thee blood in fury and jealouſie, and throw down thine eminent places, and break down thy high places, and ſtrip thee of thy cloaths, and take thy fair jewels, and leave thee naked and bare, and execute judgments upon thee, <hi>Ezek</hi> 16.15, 36, 38, 41. Doſt thou truſt in lying words, ſaying, <hi>The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord are theſe;</hi> and notwithſtanding Steal, Murder, and Commit Adultery, and Swear
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:66159:102"/>
falſly, and Burn Incenſe unto <hi>Baal,</hi> and Walk after other gods, and ſtand before the Lord, and ſay, <hi>thou art delivered to do all theſe abominations?</hi> know that theſe are lying words, that will not profit; but conſider rather, what the Lord did to <hi>Shiloh</hi> (where he ſet his name at the firſt) for the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of his people <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Jer. 7.4, 8, 12. Doſt thou truſt to thine own righteouſneſs, and commit iniquity? know that all thy righteouſneſs ſhall not be remembred, but for thine iniquity, which thou committeſt, thou ſhalt dye for it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.13. Doſt thou truſt in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men? know, that therefore a tumult ſhall ariſe among the people, and all the fortreſſes ſhall be ſpoiled, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10.13, 14. Doſt thou truſt in thine own purity, and ſay, ſtand by thy ſelf, come not near to me, for I am holier then thou? know that thou art but a ſmok in Gods Noſe, and a fire that burneth all the day, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.5. and that the Lord hath put no truſt in his Servants, and his Angels he charged with folly. How much leſs on them that dwell in houſes of clay, whoſe foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation is in the duſt, which are cruſhed before the moth, <hi>Job</hi> 4.18, 19.</p>
               <p>But after all this, perhaps thou wilt ſay, Thou wilt truſt in thine own heart, for that will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thee; wilt thou do ſo? know then thou art but a fool for thy labour in Gods account, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.26. Thy heart will deceive thee, for it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful above all things and deſperately wicked, who can know it? <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9. Thus you ſee that God alone is to be truſted in, and to truſt in any thing elſe, will be but as an <hi>Egyptian</hi> Reed to lean unto.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:66159:102"/>And as God alone is to be our rock and our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, ſo are we to make him our rock and our truſt at all times. So is the Exhortation: <hi>Truſt in him at all times; ye people, pour out your hearts before him: God is a refuge for us,</hi> Pſal. 62.8. So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.4. <hi>Truſt ye in the Lord for ever, for in the Lord</hi> Jehovah <hi>is everlaſting ſtrength: At what time I am afraid</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) I will truſt in thee</hi> (when his enemies were ready to ſwallow-him up) <hi>In God I have put my truſt, I will not fear what fleſh can do unto me,</hi> Pſal. 56.3, 4. And what ſaid <hi>Job? Though be ſlay me, yet will I truſt in him: I will maintain mine own ways before him,</hi> Job 13.15. Is it a time of evil tidings, thou wilt not be afraid, if thy heart is fixed, truſting in the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.7. Doſt thou fear the Lord, and yet walk in a dark diſconſolate eſtate? even then art thou to truſt in the Name of the Lord, and ſtay upon thy God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.10.</p>
               <p>And as thou art to make God alone thy rock, and thy refuge, and truſt in him at all times, ſo with all thy heart, <hi>Not leaning to thine own under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, but in all thy ways acknowledging him, and he ſhall direct thy paths,</hi> Prov. 3.5, 6. <hi>Yea, the Lord ſhall help thee, and deliver thee: he ſhall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thee from the wicked, and ſave thee, becauſe thou truſteſt in him,</hi> Pſal. 37.40. This <hi>David</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Pſal. 22.4, 5. <hi>Our Fathers truſted in thee: they truſted, and thou didſt deliver them.

               </p>
               <p>Well then, wouldſt thou have God to be a help and defence unto thee? Truſt in him. <hi>He is a Buckler or a ſheild, to all thoſe that truſt in him.</hi>

Pſal. 18.30. Prov. 30.5. <hi>For who is God ſave the Lord? or who is a rock ſave our God?</hi> Pſal. 18.30, 31. 1 Sam. 2.2. <hi>He is the rock, his work is perfect, for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth, and without iniquity; juſt and right is he,</hi> Deut. 32.4. Wouldſt thou be ſtedfaſt and unmovable, as the rock whereupon the Church is builded, againſt which no ſtorms, nor tempeſts; no, nor the gates of hell ſhall ever prevail. Truſt in God: <hi>They that truſt in the Lord ſhall be as Mount</hi> Sion, <hi>which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever,</hi> Pſal. 125.1.

               <p>So did <hi>Hanna</hi> in the bitterneſs of her ſoul, ſhe prayed and wept ſore, and in her ſecret retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhe poured out her ſoul before the Lord, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.10, 15. meaning the trouble and anguiſh of her heart. So <hi>David</hi> when his ſpirit was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed within him, then he cried unto the Lord, and poured out his complaint before him, and ſhewed him all his trouble, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142.1, 2, 3. So <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 20.10, 11, 12. when he lay under evil reports and defamation, and his familiars watched for his halting, what courſe does he take? He goes to God, and opens his cauſe unto him, or diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers his cauſe unto him, as to an Advocate or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron. <hi>O Lord of Hoſts</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that trieſt the righteous, and ſeeſt the reins and the heart; let me ſee thy vengeance on them, for unto thee have I opened my Cauſe.</hi> So is it ſaid of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> when he had received the Letter of railing <hi>Rabſhekah</hi> and read it, he goes up into the Houſe of the Lord, and ſpreads it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, in this manner. <hi>O Lord God of Iſrael, which dwelleſt between the Cherubims; thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth, thou haſt made heaven and earth. Lord bow down thine ear and hear: open, Lord, thine eyes and ſee: and hear the words of</hi> Sennacharib, <hi>which hath ſent him to reproach the living God.</hi> This hath been the manner of the Servants of the Lord, who have made God their habitation; they go to God in ſecret, and pour out their ſouls before him. <hi>O</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job) that I knew where I might find him, that I might come even to his ſeat? I would order my cauſe
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:66159:104"/>
before him, and fill my mouth with arguments,</hi> Job 23.3, 4. Holy <hi>Job</hi> (even now a Proverb, or a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy rather) perceiving his freinds diſcourſes, were fuller of reproaches then conſolations, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects to anſwer them, and reſolves to get him to God, the onely ſupport and refuge of the miſerable.</p>
               <p>The ſoareſt ſtrokes, cannot drive away gracious ſouls from God, but rather draw them nearer unto him; they ſeldome or never think themſelves near enough unto God, its Sun, and Sheild, and Center. O that I knew where to find him, that I might come even to his Seat. And Gods Judgment-ſeat, where he ſits to hear and determine Cauſes, is not terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or unapproachable to a Beleiver, who knows it to be a Throne of Mercy, as <hi>Job</hi> did here. And happy are all that can ſay ſo; <hi>For we muſt all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear defore the Judgment-ſeat of Chriſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10, 11. and it will be terrible to all thoſe that do not often reſort thither before hand. And it is good to have our hearts and mouths fill'd with Arguments, when we come to plead, and expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and reaſon out our great concernments with our God; who hath all good things lying ready by him, and waits only for Prayer to come and fetch them away. Not that God ſtands in need of our informing him concerning our neceſſities, which he knows better then we; but becauſe hereby we give ſome proof, that we are not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrangers at home (as many careleſs ones are) but know ſomething of our ſelves and our own caſes, and of him and his dealings towards us. If our mouths then be fill'd with arguments, we may be ſure of an Anſwer. God will not ſit ſtill and ſay nothing, he will not ſit like an Image, like a dumb

Idol, as the Abominations of the Heathens, their <hi>Dii Stercorei,</hi> their Dunghil Gods (as they are called, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.17.) muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty do, they can do no otherwiſe, though men fill their mouths with Arguments, and empty their veins of their blood before them, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.28. Go boldly then to the Throne of grace, plead with God, and fill your mouthes with argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; ſpread thy complaints before him, and open thy cauſe unto him, for when ever you do ſo, beyond all, peradventure, God will anſwer; There's no fear that he will interpret this ſawcineſs and preſumption in thee, and ſo anſwer thee with his fiſts about thine ears, or with his foot to kick thee out of his preſence; there is no fear that he will ſmother thee under the waight of his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or dazle thee with his beams, or burn thee with his flames, or drive thee from the judgement ſeat, as <hi>Gallio</hi> did the Jews, Act. 18.16. No, he never beats his people lower then their knees, and thence ſuffers them, yea, helps them to riſe again; nay, he will lay his hand upon thy head; yea, under thy feet to do thee good; he will ſtroke rather then ſtrike a pleading ſoul; He will ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en thee, and put mettle into thee; He will not plead againſt thee with his great and abſolute power.</p>
               <p>So he dealt with <hi>Daniel</hi> a man that had great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate acquaintance with God, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.19.

And he invites his people to come and plead freely, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.26. <hi>Put me in remembrance, ſaith the Lord, let us plead together, declare, that thou mayſt be juſtified; if thou haſte any thing to ſay for thy ſelf, ſay on.</hi> Yea, Idolaters ſhall have this permiſſion, to plead for themſelves and their dumb Idols, if they have any thing to ſay for them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.21. <hi>Produce your cauſe, ſaith the Lord, bring forth your ſtrong reaſons, ſaith the King of</hi> Jacob, Shall Idolaters have this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and not the true Worſhippers, that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him in Spirit and in truth?

Yes doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, this is that boldneſs of ſpeech, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.4. mentioned as the great priviledge of the Saints, eſpecially now under the new Teſtament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Accedamus cum loquendi ubertate ad thronum gratiae</hi> Letus come boldly unto the throne of grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19. Having therefore boldneſs to enter into the holieſt by the blood of Jeſus, (a right and freedom to enter in with our perſons hereafter, and now by our Prayers) let us draw neer with a true heart, with full aſſurance of faith; He hath given us two great friends of his for our Advocates, the one at his own right hand in heaven, moving and negotiating, and always appearing for us; the other ſeated in our breaſts, his holy ſpirit, making interceſſion for us. Yea, the Fathers own heart is full of love, brim full, and running over, and he loves to hear his children reaſon it out with him; and he doth of ſet purpoſe delay to grant their requeſts ſometimes, becauſe he loves to hear often from them, to hear their voices, and ſee
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:66159:105"/>
their faces, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.14. to hear what they can ſay for themſelves: and ſo he dealt with the woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> in thoſe ſeveral repulſes he gave her, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.22, 23.

O the ſecret, intimate, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly familiarity, that is betwixt God and the gratious beleiving ſoul; It is ſaid of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that the Lord ſpake unto him face to face, as a man ſpeaketh unto his friend, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.11. That is, plainly, familiarly. The like phraſe is uſed of ſpeaking mouth to mouth. <hi>My ſervant</hi> Moſes (ſaith the Lord) <hi>is not ſo, who is faithful in all mine houſe; With him will I ſpeak mouth to mouth, even ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently, and not in dark ſpeeches,</hi> Numb. 12.7, 8. Well then, if thou makeſt God thy habitation, thou wilt not, thou canſt not be a ſtranger to God, thou wilt have ſome intimacy with him, ſome ſecret talk and communion with him; thou wilt ever and anon be opening thy heart unto him, and be pleading and expoſtulating the caſe with him. <hi>Daniel</hi> could not be reſtrained from this, though he knew the decree or writing was ſigned, that whoſoever ſhould ask any petition of any God or Man for thirty days, ſave of the King <hi>Darius,</hi> he ſhould be caſt into the Den of Lyons. But he goes into his Houſe and kneels upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God as he did aforetime, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.10. he would rather dye then omit his wonted Worſhip, and that cloſe intimate communion he had with the Lord in prayer. And it muſt needs be ſo; for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever natural men and worldlings, out of their obnoxiouſneſs and ſecret terror do ſlaviſhly retire,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:66159:106"/>
and do not willingly, neither dare they draw near to that God, which to them is a conſuming fire, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.29. Yet all theſe, who have truly taſted how gracious the Lord is, ſhall find their hearts out of a ſecret ſence of Gods love unto them firſt, kindly inflamed with infinite deſire to live under the comfortable influence of his pleaſed countenance, to enjoy his holy Majeſty with conſtant peace, and an humble ſpiritual acceſs and acquaintance conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually. His ſpirit of Prayer, infinite love, yea, all his loving kindneſs, protections, preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, bounty, patience, divine illuminations, ſpiritual bleſſings, exerciſe of repentance, temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and troubles from Satan, preſſures and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions from the world, loſs of inward peace, faintneſs of faith, want of ſpiritual ſtrength, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault of ſome ſpecial ſin, ſweetneſs of meditation, daily favours ſhowred down without number, and above meaſure, the forethought of the great and laſt account, motions of the bleſſed ſpirit, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual deſertion, &amp;c. but above all, the unutte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and inexpreſſible bleſſedneſs, goodneſs, and excellency of that higheſt Majeſty it ſelf, are, and ſhould be quickening and powerful motives to drive us frequently and inceſſantly unto God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But perhaps thou wilt ſay; It is true, the righteous may be thus familiar with him, plead with him, and not be caſt in their ſuit; But where are thoſe righteous ones?

A righteouſneſs ſpun and woven out of his own bowels, and the obedience of his dear Son, a better then ever came upon the back of Angels; for which the perſonal and legal righteouſneſs of a <hi>Paul,</hi> of an Angel is to be abandoned; <hi>Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> being far better then <hi>Angelical righteouſneſs.</hi> Thou canſt not miſs a bleſſing in his garments, who is not aſhamed to be called thine Elder Brother; who came to change cloaths and places with thee, and to take all upon himſelf, that thou mighteſt eſcape.

               <p>And we forget that there is ſuch a Prompter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Hangings, ſuch an Interpreter (as his Title ſignifies, as well as a Comforter; <hi>Ille ſuggerit vobis omnia, He ſhall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance,</hi> Joh. 14.26.) ſuch an Interpreter, I ſay, to make known the mind of God to us, and ours to him; and as he betrayes the ſecrets of God to the Saints, ſo he rips up their hearts before God, and fills there mouths, not only with windy words, but weighty argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

that galls thy ſhoulders? no violence and ſpoil to cry out and complain of? Sure thou haſt not ſtudied thine own caſe, thou haſt not ordered thy cauſe aright, if this fountain fail thee.</p>

               <p>Even ſo it is with the Soul, that makes God his habitation. O the intercourſe of delights that is betwixt God, Chriſt, his Spirit, and the gracious beleiving ſoul.

What does it contain as the cheif matter thereof, but a moſt excellent Marriage Song, by way of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue between Chriſt and his Church?

Allegorical and Rhetorical words; the true hearty love, and the moſt excellent benefits and favours of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt the Bridegrome, unto the Chriſtian Church his Spouſe or Bride. And on the other ſide, the earneſt and hearty long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Spouſe his Church, after her beloved Bridegroom the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, is ſingularly demonſtrated and held forth.</p>
               <p>In it the Bridegroom and his Bride do highly extol and praiſe each other. The Bride to ſet forth his excellent dignity, his riches, and glory, with all thoſe ſweet things that flow unto her from him; ſhe doth bring in all the ſtatelieſt, the richeſt, the goodlieſt, and the ſweeteſt things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heaven. The like doth He in praiſing her beauty, and her delectable ſweetneſs.</p>
               <p>From hence doth ſpring the great delight and pleaſure, which the one taketh in the other, where they do (as it were) unfold the vehement paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Love with that fervent deſire which ſhe hath to be moſt nearly joyned unto him, and to dwell with him for ever. Alſo there do many goodly tokens paſs between them: For he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweth upon her very rich jewels and heavenly ornaments, to deck and to beautifie her withal; and ſhe again rendreth unto him, the ſweet fruits of her love. <hi>Let him kiſs me</hi> (ſaith the Spouſe) <hi>with the kiſſes of his mouth for thy love is bteter then wine. Becauſe of the ſavour of thy good ointments, thy name is as ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee.

So <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. even the whole thereof, ſave a verſe or two, is the ſpeech of the Bridegroom, conſiſting in praiſes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations of the Bride, in declaration of his love towards her. <hi>Behold thou art fair my Love, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thou art fair, thou haſt Doves eyes within thy locks,</hi> verſ. 1. <hi>Thou art all fair, my Love, there is no ſpot in thee,</hi> verſ. 7. <hi>Thou haſt raviſhed my heart, my ſiſter, my ſpouſe; thou haſt raviſhed my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck,</hi> verſ. 9. <hi>How fair is thy love, my ſiſter, my ſpouſe, how much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is thy love then wine? and the ſmell of thine oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments then all ſpices?

So <hi>Chap.</hi> 6, 7. How does the Lord Jeſus give forth very great and ſingular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations of his ſpouſe, teſtifying his great love and hearty affection towards her: <hi>Thou art beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, O my Love, as</hi> Tirzah, <hi>comely as</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>&amp;c.

laid together. <hi>They be rare things, that Princes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth do wonder at: moſt rare which the Kings of Kings hath in admiration.</hi> I inſtance this, to let you ſee the mutual ſolace and delight, that is betwixt Chriſt and the gratious ſoul.</p>
               <p>And ſurely, if thou haſt taſted that the Lord is gratious thou canſt not but take ſweet delight, contentation and delectation in him. <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.3. <hi>I ſate down under his ſhadow with great delight, and his fruit was ſweet to my taſte.</hi> The ſhadow of a tree (as all men know) is very comfortable, and doth refreſh thoſe that are parched with the ſcorching heat of the Sun. When the Church is under hot perſecutions and fiery temptations of Satan, and the burning heat of Gods wrath for ſins guilt in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; what, but Chriſt can be as a ſhadow to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.20. <hi>There ſhall be a Tabernacle for a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow in the day time from the heat,</hi> Iſa. 4.6. <hi>Thou haſt been a ſtrength to the poor, a ſtrength to the needy in his diſtreſs, a refuge from the ſtorm, a ſhadow from the heat, when the blaſt of the terrible ones is as a ſtorm againſt the wall,</hi> Iſa. 25 4. And this was not all, but ſaith the Souſe, <hi>His fruit was ſweet to my taſte,</hi> or to my pallate.</p>
               <p>She doth not only receive comfortable refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhadow from this fruitful tree, but ſhe eateth of the Apples alſo which it beareth, and the ſame are ſweet and pleaſant to her taſte: Which is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther benefit the Spouſe enjoyeth by Chriſt; To wit, that ſhe is not only freed and delivered from evil, but made partaker of his goodneſs; in that all the works of his Propheſie, Preiſthood, and Kingdom; his Death, Reſurrection, Aſcention, and all the fruits of them are communicated unto
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:66159:109"/>
her by the Goſpel; which ſhe feedeth upon by faith, to the abundant refreſhing and ſatisfaction of her ſoul.</p>
               <p>Fruits ſignifying good works and the Graces of Gods Spirit, which are to the benefit of our ſelves and others, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.8, 10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. which is alſo applied to the Doctrine of the Goſpel, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.16. and ſignifieth a comfortable reward, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58.11. and <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.18. So <hi>David</hi> he expreſſeth his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in God, by the Delight he took in his words or promiſes rather, <hi>How ſweet are thy words unto my taſte? yea, ſweeter then honey to my mouth,</hi> Pſal. 119.103. How ſweet? I am not not able to expreſs the ſweetneſs of them. How ſweet unto my taſte, unto my mouth? that is, unto the mouth of my heart and ſoul, for otherwiſe the ſpiritual promiſes yeild but little ſweetneſs unto the bodily mouth. <hi>They are more ſweet and pleaſant unto my mind, then honey is to my mouth.</hi> He meaneth, that he never taſted any meat with his mouth, how good or pleaſant ſoever it were, as he felt Gods word ſweet and comfortable to his ſoul.</p>
               <p>To which agrees that in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19 8, 10. <hi>The ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of the Lord are right, rejoycing the heart. More to be deſired are they then gold; yea, then much fine gold, ſweeter alſo then the honey, and the honey-comb.</hi> And in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.11. <hi>Thy Teſtimonies have I taken as an heritage forever: for they are the rejoycing of my heart.</hi> Yea, ſo delighted was he in the Lord, that he would never think of him, but his medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him ſhould be ſweet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.34. His ſoul ſhould be ſatisfied as with marrow and fatneſs, and his mouth ſhould praiſe him with joyful lips; when he remembred God upon his bed, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:66159:110"/>
on him in the night watches, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.5, 6. What more pleaſant and delectable to the palate then marrow and fatneſs? and ſuch was the medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God to his ſoul, even in the night watches, in the darkeſt and moſt diſmal ſeaſon of Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations.</p>
               <p>To this agrees that in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.8. <hi>They ſhall be abundantly ſatisfied with the fatneſs of thy houſe: and thou ſhalt make them drink of the river of thy pleaſures.</hi> There's a river of pleaſures and delights that flow from God, which as a well of living wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and an ever-ſpringing in-exhauſtible fountain of life and all divine graces, can never be drawn dry; but the ſtreams thereof are always running, <hi>To make glad the City of God,</hi> Pſal. 46.4. Hence it is that the ſouls Communion with Chriſt, and its ſpiritual participating of Chriſt in his Ordinances, is held forth under the term of Supping with Chriſt. <hi>If any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will ſup with him, and he with me,</hi> Revel. 3.20. I will communicate my ſelf unto him; have mutual fellowſhip with him; I will dwell in him ſpiritually, really, operatively by my grace; and he ſhall dwell in me by faith, feed upon me, receive ſtrength and nouriſhment from me, and ſo come to participate of my divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Hereby then mayſt thou come to know whether thou makeſt God thy Habitation or not: Men take delight in their habitations, there they ſolace and recreat themſelves; and Husband and Wife take mutual comfort and contentation in each other. Conſider then what delight thou haſt in God, in Chriſts in his way and worſhip, his ordinances and
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:66159:110"/>
holy appointments, <hi>Job</hi> 27.10. Doſt thou take delight in approaching to God? Is thy delight in the Law of the Lord, and in that Law doſt thou meditate day and night? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.22. Are his teſtimonies thy delight and thy counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.24. Is his word unto thee, the joy and rejoycing of thine heart? as it was to that good Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Jer. 15.16. And doſt thou delight to do the will of God, as Chriſt did his Fathers, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.8. What fellowſhip and ſociety is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Chriſt and thy Soul? <hi>Our fellowſhip</hi> (ſaith <hi>John) is with the Father, and his Son Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3. The baptized and new added mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to the Church, continued ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles Doctrine and Fellowſhip, and in break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of bread, and in prayers, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41, 42. They held communion with Chriſt, and each with other in breaking of bread, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. They aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together, prayed together, praiſed God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſung together, ſuffered and rejoyced toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.31. <hi>and</hi> 2.47. <hi>and</hi> 16.25. <hi>and</hi> 5.41.</p>
               <p>Conſider then, what entertainment thou haſt with Chriſt, does he invite thee to come unto him? and does he bid thee welcome when thou comeſt? does he bid thee eat that which is good? and that thy ſoul ſhould delight it ſelf in fatneſs? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1, 2. Waſt thou never at dinner or ſupper with him, when he killed his beaſts, mingled his wine, and furniſhed his table? and hath he not bade thee to eat of his bread, and drink of the wine which he hath mingled? <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.1, 2, 5. Chriſt keeps a plentiful table, you'l hardly find ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther noble and generous houſe-keeper. When he prepares a dinner, he kills his oxen and his
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:66159:111"/>
fatlings, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.4. and will entertain thee with a ſecond courſe alſo; He has his fruit thats very ſweet to the taſte, his flagons and his apples, the one to ſtay thee, the other to comfort thee. And as Princes and great Perſons have, he has a noble Banquetting houſe too, or houſe of wine for to welcome thee; and if then he finds thee but a little ſick of love, he will not ſhun to put his left-hand under thy head, and with his right-hand to embrace thee; yea, his Banner over thee ſhall be love, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.3, 4, 5, 6.</p>
               <p>But now if their be no ſuch intercourſes of love and mutual delight betwixt Chriſt and thy ſoul? If thou art ſtill a ſtranger unto him, and knowſt not what it is to have communion with him, or to be ſupping with him? If when he has bidden thee to the wedding, and hath made all things ready, and ſent out his ſervants to call thee, and thou ſhalt make light of it, and refuſe to come, and chuſe rather to go to thy Farm or Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, and be feeding ſtill upon thy husks, or be making excuſes, and telling him thou haſt bought five yoke of oxen, and thou muſt go to prove them; or haſt married a Wife, and therefore thou canſt not come: Or if thou ſhouldſt do worſe then this, take his ſervants and entreat them ſpightfully and ſlay them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.5, 6. comp. with <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.16. Let me tell thee, thou wilt incenſe him great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, even to ſend forth his Armies to deſtroy thee. I ſay, if thy heart is dead, and drowſie, and eſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God; and void of love, and dutiful affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Chriſt; thou art far from dwelling in the ſecret place of the moſt high, and making him thy habitation.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:66159:111"/>5. A mans houſe is the chief place of his nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation and commerce; where does a man drive his trade, and utter his commodities, but at home, in his houſe or in his ſhop? So it is with the ſoul that makes God his habitation; he drives a ſpecial trade and commerce with God; makes Religion his buſineſs; Chriſt invites all to come and buy of his Commodities, and he expoſes rich commodities to ſale, and there are ſouls that do trade and traffick with him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1. <hi>Ho, every one that thirſteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money, come ye, buy and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out price; Wherefore do ye ſpend money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which ſatisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat that which is good, &amp;c.</hi> Chriſt excites and ſtirs up all that do thirſt, and greatly long after righteouſneſs, being ſenſible of their own ſins, their nothingneſs and unworthineſs to come unto him, as to the fountain of living waters, that is, by faith to beleive on him, and <hi>then out of his belly</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall flow rivers of living water, but this ſpake he of the ſpirit,</hi> Joh. 7.37. He invites all, I ſay, that are money-leſs, and poor worthleſs, helpleſs, and meritleſs creatures, to come unto him and buy thoſe heavenly goods which he offers unto us by the Goſpel; namely, wine and milk, that is, all things requiſite and neceſſary for our ſpiritual life; the graces and fruits of the ſpirit, which are ſweet and delightful as wine; and which are as neceſſary to a heavenly life, as milk is to this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural life, and may take in alſo forgiveneſs of ſins, and the pure and unſpotted righteouſneſs of Chriſt
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:66159:112"/>
(which are given us of God in him, and that freely for nought, and without any merits and deſerts of ours) together with life eternal. <hi>And wherefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>do ye ſpend money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which ſatisfieth not? or waigh out your money for that which is not bread?</hi> Wherefore are ye at ſo great coſt and charges in vain, and take pains and toil to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for dry, empty, husky, unſatisfying, unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and unprofitable things? which when you have them, and enjoy them, will miniſter no true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, nor ſatisfaction unto your ſoul. How vain and profuſe was the Prodigal, to waſte his ſubſtance with riotous living, to purchaſe to himſelf a few husks, unſatisfying food, which the ſwine did eat; which when he had them, was ready to periſh with hunger, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.13, 17. Of ſuch the Lord complain'd by the Prophet <hi>Haggai, Ye have ſown much, and bring in little: ye eat, but ye have not enough: ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink: ye cloth you, but there is none warm: and he that earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth wages, earneth wages to put it into a bag of holes,</hi> Hag. 1.6. A ſore judgment to beſtow ones labour and pains for that which ſatisfieth not. <hi>Wilt thou ſet thine eyes</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) upon that which is not,</hi> Prov. 23.5. what is that which is not? the <hi>verſ.</hi> before tells us. He exhorts that we labour not to be rich, and that we ceaſe from our own wiſdom. What are riches nothing? nor a mans own wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom nothing? which the world ſo highly eſteems of, and ſo eagerly purſueth after: No, they are nothing, that is, as it were nothing, they are not matters or things of any great importance, for thee to ſet thine eyes upon; and therefore thou
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:66159:112"/>
ſhouldſt not ſo greedily gape after them, or ſet thine eyes or heart upon them; becauſe, when thou haſt attained them, thou haſt got as much as a thing of nothing: And adds another reaſon, taken from the uncertainty of riches. <hi>For riches certainly make themſelves wings, they fly away as an Eagle towards heaven:</hi> that is, they fly ſwiftly away. The Eagle flyeth ſo ſwiftly on high towards hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as that he is ſoon vaniſhed away out of a mans ſight, ſo do riches ſuddenly periſh and vaniſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; being ſubject to fire and water, evil debters, and many other caſualties. And therefore ceaſe from thine own wiſdom, which may rather be called <hi>diſtruſt</hi> in God, and <hi>covetouſneſs</hi> then wiſdom; when it ſhall violently carry thee away with a deſire after riches, which are ſo tranſitory and vain. And therefore it is that Jeſus Chriſt does invite theſe fooliſh traders to come and buy of his wares, of his commodities, that are not fading and periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your ſoul delight it ſelf in fatneſs.

laſting commodities, ſound wares that will not fail you; <hi>Riches and honours are with me, yea, durable riches and righteouſneſs; my fruit is better then gold, yea, then fine gold; and my revenue then choiſe ſilver; I lead in the way of righteouſneſs, in the midſt of the paths of judgment; That I may cauſe thoſe that love me to inherit ſubſtance, and I will fill their treaſures,</hi> Prov. 8.18, 19, 20, 21. Mark, I pray you, <hi>Riches and honours are with me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, that is, true riches and honour, ſuch as will not fade and flye away, and they are with me, in my power to give and beſtow them, when and upon whom I lift; even durable riches, ſuch as ſhall continue, when other mens ſhall melt away as wax before the Sun; And thoſe that love me, that is, thoſe that do unfainedly love me, ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit ſubſtance, that which is durable; meaning ſuch wealth or ſubſtance as is ſuch really and indeed, and bringeth to man the greateſt happineſs and proſperity, even eternal life, that endureth for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Thus you ſee, there is a trade, that Chriſt and the beleiving ſoul does drive together, and all Chriſts commodities, they are rich ſubſtantial commodities, whoever have them ſhall inherit ſubſtance; not ſhadows but ſubſtance, like unto the Merchandiſe of <hi>Tyre,</hi> whoſe Merchandiſe and hire ſhall be holineſs to the Lord, and ſhall be for them that dwell before the Lord (whoſe habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord is, mark that) to eat ſufficiently, and for durable cloathing, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 23.18. What can be better then ſatisfying food, and laſting cloathing, like the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> cloaths in the Wilderneſs, which waxed not old, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.5. The neceſſity and excellency of which, the Lord Jeſus ſets forth in

that exhortation of his to the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> Rev. 3.18. <hi>I counſel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayſt be rich; and white rayment, that thou mayſt be cloathed, and that the ſhame of thy nakedneſs do not appear; and annoint thine eyes with eye-ſalve, that thou mayſt ſee.</hi> I counſel thee to buy of me (ſaith Chriſt) from whence obſerve that; all true ſpiritual riches and graces, (all ſubſtantial commodities) are to be fetched from Chriſt alone.

                  </gap>, by, and through the Son; and it is moſt juſt it ſhould be ſo, it being the purchaſe of his death and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he powred out his ſoul unto death for us, that he might have power to heal our ſouls of all their infirmities; therefore he is made unto us, both wiſdom, juſtification, ſanctification, and all in all. And what are thoſe precious commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities that Chriſt would have this Church of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odicea,</hi> and us alſo (if we be found in the ſame vain-glorious, yet beggerly condition, as ſhe was in) to buy of him? Surely, even ſuch as might be a remedy proportionable to her diſeaſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Here is gold, not outward glittering, or pretended gold, but tryed gold offered, to help her of her poverty.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:66159:114"/>2. Here is white rayment, a glorious rayment, of Chriſts righteouſneſs offered, to cover her ſhame and nakedneſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Here is eye-ſalve offered, even true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and wiſdom from above, the ſpirits divine illumination to cure her of her blindneſs, that ſhe might ſee the way to everlaſting happineſs. And the manner of ſeeking and obtaining theſe rich commodities is as it were by bargain and ſale; <hi>I counſel thee to buy of me;</hi> And let us inquire a little how this bargain is made up.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Underſtand in all legal contracts, there is an agreement of both parties, or elſe it cannot be a bargain.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In ſome bargains and contracts, there is a legal conſideration, given for the thing bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained for, either to the full value, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what equitably, proportionable thereunto; Or,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There are other abſolute bargains and ſales of Lands and Goods, diſpoſed therein freely, onely on the conſideration of the Donors or Granters, love, affection, and preferment to the parties beloved, and ſo given freely to them and their heirs for ever, without ſo much as paying a Penny by way of legal retribution for it; Yea, the Donor often is ſo free in his deed of gift, that the Donee is freed of all fear of forfeiture of his eſtate; for there is not reſerved ſo much as a Roſe or Pepper-corn by way of Rent, that for non-payment thereof the ſtate ſhould become forfeited. And that party that would not be thankful to ſuch a free-giver, is worſe then an Infidel.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:66159:114"/>Now to apply this to our heavenly bargain: If we will buy of Chriſt gold and heavenly treaſure, we muſt firſt come unto him, and ſtrike up the bargain with him. He will not ſell unto us againſt our wills (though he himſelf muſt make us firſt willing) and therefore he crys, as before, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1. <hi>Come unto the waters, come ye, buy and eat.</hi> And <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.17. <hi>And the Spirit and the Bride ſay, Come, and let him that is a thriſt, Come; and whoſoever will, let him take the water of Life freely.</hi> And they now that will not be obedient to the commands and laws of this gratious Donor, by way of gratitude and thankfulneſs, for ſo glorious and free an Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance beſtowed upon them; are not worthy of the leaſt mercy in his kingdom.</p>
               <p>If this inheritance were entailed on us, on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of payment or performance of a ſmall petty grain of Corn, or the like, as is the mite of our faith and obedience, we ſhould be in bondage, fear and danger all our lifelong, if not, at leaſt forfeit all by our non-payment and performance: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bleſſed be God, that hath not left our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in our own hands, but founded it on Chriſt, the rock which cannot be removed. Now he that goes about to buy a great Treaſure, is very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, diligent, and his affections intenſe upon it, that none put him by of his bargain: So it muſt be here for this Heavenly Treaſure, we muſt be earneſt with Chriſt to ſtrike up this bargain, we muſt not let him alone by our prayers, until we have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained this precious pearl at his hand. 'Tis true, Chriſt will ſell us this pearl freely, yet we muſt agree with him for it; though we have nothing to give him in the leaſt, by way of legal compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:66159:115"/>
for it, yet me muſt buy it, receive it in his own way and method.</p>
               <p>If you will buy any goods, that you want, you muſt repair to the Fair, Houſe, or Place where it is to be bought: So if you want tryed gold to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich you, or garments to cover you, or eye-ſalve to inlighten you; you muſt come to Chriſt, who is the Merchant of theſe heavenly wares, upon his Fair-days, or when he opens ſhop, when ſuch precious wares are ſet to ſale: To his Ordinances, in his Aſſemblies on the publique days of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Bartering, if you will attain unto this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Treaſure?</p>
               <p>And theſe are Commodities worth the buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the tryed gold that comes from Chriſt is ſuch that makes the ſoul truly gratious where it is; and it is truly refined gold, becauſe it is the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and way of God, which is as gold refined, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.10. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.6. It is tryed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will hold water; we may become rich in the eyes of the world, in parts, abilities, and humane learning; and they may ſhine like gold in the eyes of the in-judicious, ſimple and ignorant: but alas, if Chriſt doth not ſanctifie them unto us, they may make us the worſe, not the better for them. So for the white garment that muſt cloath us. Chriſts garment is ſuch a garment that will reach us from top to toe, that no part of our ſhame or nakedneſs ſhall appear.</p>
               <p>Sin brings ſhame, and ſin brings contempt and nakedneſs upon us; and Chriſts raiment is a white raiment, an innocent raiment, a glorious honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble raiment; which will not only cover all our ſhame and nakedneſs, that the pure eyes of God
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:66159:115"/>
ſhall not behold it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.10. but therein alſo (he having granted thee to be arrayed therewith) will preſent thee therein glorious to himſelf, without ſpot, or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.27. and therefore ſurely it is worth the buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: our own raiments are ſpotted, defiled, and will not ſerve the turn, but Chriſts is white all over. If we expect to appear perfectly righteous, holy and juſt before God (or otherwiſe we ſhall never appear before him to approbation and abſolution, for no unclean thing ſhall enter into his preſence) then we muſt be ſure to cloath our ſelves in the white raiment of this our Elder Brother.</p>
               <p>So for the Eye-ſalve, with which our eyes muſt be anointed, if we will be cured of our blindneſs, and ſee the way to everlaſting happineſs. Surely this is of excellent uſe, and worth the buying, and where are we to get it but from Chriſt? <hi>He is given for a Covenant to open the eyes of the blind, and to bring out the Priſoners from the Priſon, and them that ſit in darkneſs out of the Priſon-houſe, to lead them in the paths of life,</hi> Iſa. 42.6, 7. and <hi>Pro.</hi> 8.20. Its in vain to go to our own prudence or carnal wiſdom, that will more entangle us, and darken us, and lead us out of the way, according to that of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.39. <hi>I am come into this world for Judgment, that they that ſee not, ſhould ſee; and that they that ſee</hi> (that is, in their own wiſdom) <hi>ſhould be made blind.</hi> Chriſt made an Eye-ſalve for the cure of the blind perſon, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.6. of his ſpittle and clay, a compound matter, proceeding from his mouth and the earth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he made the blind man ſee: Chriſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:66159:116"/>
follows the ſame method, in his compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of Eye-ſalve, which he uſes towards his ſpiritual blind ſouls that he takes to cure:</p>
               <p>Firſt, He gives us the knowledge of our ſelves, and of our own earthly matter, and that we ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in our unregeneracy, nothing but of earth and earthlineſs.</p>
               <p>Next he brings us to the knowledge of himſelf and his word, which proceedeth out of his mouth; and ſo makes us a happy compoſition and Eye-ſalve; whereby we come to ſee our poverty, our ſhame and nakedneſs, and all our ſpiritual wants; and alſo where remedy is to be had, to heal and to ſave us from all our maladies.</p>
               <p>And indeed, this is as great a bleſſing as Chriſt can beſtow upon us, to be truly ſenſible, and to have a clear ſight of our condition, it is the next ſtop to amendment, it is ignorance and blindneſs that makes us err and go aſtray; but true ſaving knowledge will keep us cloſe to Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. If we take any other Eye-ſalve to anoint our eyes with, ſave what Chriſt hath prepared for us in the Treaſury of his Word, we may take Bird-lime inſtead of Eye-ſalve, which will cloſe our eyes the faſter. They are not the traditions of men, nor the wiſdom and underſtanding of the wiſe that will make this precious ointment; but it is a ſpiritual extraction and ointment, drawn out by the ſpirit of Chriſt, out of the holy Limbeck of his Word, and applyed by him unto the blind patient; that will make him ſee the glory of God and his grace, and to praiſe him for it to all eternity.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee there are rich and precious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities to be had in Chriſt, and Chriſt ſets them
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:66159:116"/>
to ſale, and invites us to come and buy them of him; and there is a ſpiritual and heavenly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce that is driven betwixt Chriſt and the belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſoul: And no marvail, for where elſe ſhall the ſoul in all its exigents and ſtraights have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, if not unto Chriſt? <hi>In whom are hid all the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledge,</hi> Col. 2.3. <hi>And in whom dwelleth all the fullneſs of the God-head bodily,</hi> verſ. 9. And as he is full of grace and truth, ſo it is, <hi>Of his fulneſs that we all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and grace for grace,</hi> Joh. 1.14, 16. Thus I have ſhewed you in ſeveral particulars, what it is to dwell in the Secret Place of the moſt high, and what it is to make God our Habitation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To have our fixed Habitation and Abode in God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To make God our Refuge and Strength.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To make God the place of our Secret Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To make him the Place, or Object of our delight.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To make him the Place of our Negotiation and Commerce.</p>
               <p>Which to do, will aſſuredly intitle and intereſt us in the promiſes of protection and preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even from this ſore Viſitation of the Lord, the noiſome Peſtilence, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.1, 3. <hi>He that dwelleth in the ſecret place of the moſt high, ſhall abide under the ſhadow of the Almighty. Surely, he ſhall deliver thee from the ſnare of the fowler: and from the noyſome Peſtilence. He ſhall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings ſhalt thou truſt: his truth ſhall be thy ſheild and buckler. Thou ſhalt not be afraid for the terrour by night: nor for the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:66159:117"/>
that flyeth by day: nor for the Peſtilence that walketh in darkneſs: nor for the deſtruction that waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at noon day.</hi> So in the 9, 10. verſ. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the moſt high thy habitation: There ſhall no evil befal thee, neither ſhall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.</hi> Which promiſes, though it cannot be denied, but they had a ſpecial reference unto Chriſt, yet ſo to Chriſt, as not excluding his members.</p>
               <p>For the head cannot be ſevered from the body, but head and members make one perfect and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire body. Now if we are the Body of Chriſt, and Chriſt the Head of this Body; as ſo it is, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18, 24. then ſurely all the good and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort that the head partakes of, cannot but be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable to the reſt of the body. <hi>For from the head, all the body by joynts and bands having nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment miniſtred and knit together, encreaſeth with the encreaſe of God,</hi> Col. 2.19. So that I conceive there is not a promiſe in the Word of God, that is made unto Chriſt the Head, but all the members of his Body are intereſſed and concern'd in it. And ſo much does the prayer of our deer Lord im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. <hi>That they all may become one, as thou Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther art in me, and I in thee; that they alſo may be one with us. I in them, and thou in me, that thy may be made perfect in one,</hi> Joh. 17.21, 23.</p>
               <p>Is it promiſed to Chriſt that he ſhall have a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and that all People, Nations and Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ſhall ſerve him? <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.11.

The very ſame is promiſed to the Goſpel-ſuffering, endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, over-coming Saints in the latter day, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.26, 27. Is it propheſied or fore-ſpoken of Chriſt, that out of his mouth goeth a ſharp ſword, even a two edged ſword, that with it he ſhall ſmite the Nations? <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.16. and <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.15. The ſame is propheſied and fore-told of the Goſpel-Saints in the latter day, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149.6, 7, 8, 9.

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:66159:120"/>
he, <hi>and was not aſhamed of my chain. The Lord grant unto him, that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day; and in how many things he miniſtred unto me at</hi> Epheſus, <hi>thou knowoſt very well.</hi> It ſeems he was a very charitable ſoul; He did not (as many profeſſours of our times do, talk much and do little, have their mouths open, but the bowels of their compaſſions ſhut faſt enough, his readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to diſtribute, and willingneſs to communicate, did clearly and plainly demonſtrate, his care to lay up in ſtore for himſelf a good foundation againſt the time to come, that he might lay hold on eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life. According to the counſel that <hi>Paul</hi> gives to the worldly rich men of his time, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17, 18, 19. To which concurs that of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 11.17. <hi>The merciful man doth good to his own ſoul, but he that is cruel, troubleth his own fleſh.</hi> The merciful man, the Hebrew it ſeems renders it, a man of mercifulneſs, of bounty, liberality; So a man of knowledge, that is, a knowing and underſtanding man; a man of truth or faithfulneſs, that is, a true or faithful man, <hi>Neh.</hi> 7.2. A man of peace, that is, one that is peaceable; Men of holineſs, that is, holy men, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.31. This man that is merciful to others that are neceſſitous, and in diſtreſs; or as <hi>James</hi> expreſſeth it, that viſiteth the Fatherleſs and Widows in their affliction, and hides not himſelf from his own fleſh, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.7. (For what is mercy but a pittying of others that are in miſery? Mercy and miſery being relatives, were there no want nor treſpaſs, there needed no mercy;) This man, ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> doth good to his own ſoul, or as other tranſlations have it, he rewardeth his own ſoul, he doth good unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:66159:121"/>
as well as unto others, for it pleaſeth God to reward the good works of his poor Servants, according to that of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 11.25. <hi>The liberal ſoul ſhall be made fat, and he that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth, ſhall be watered alſo himſelf.</hi> And of that of our bleſſed Lord, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.42. who brings it down to a cup of cold water onely, that this merciful man ſhall give to drink to one of his little ones, which <hi>Mark</hi> expounds to ſuch as belong to him, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.41. <hi>Verily, I ſay unto you,</hi> ſaith our dear Lord, <hi>he ſhall in no wiſe looſe his reward;</hi> which gives us ſome light into that expreſſion of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> in his advice, as before, to rich men. Of laying up in ſtore for themſelves a good foundation againſt the time to come; Some reads, for in ſtore, laying up for a Treaſure, a good foundation, that is, a foundation of hope; Not that the liberality of the rich does merit it, but becauſe it is a fruit of faith, and God hath promiſed to reward the ſame grace for Chriſts ſake; It being a ſacrifice with which he is well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.16 Or as <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſeth it, in <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.18. An odour of a ſweet and fragrant ſmell, a ſacrifice acceptable, well-pleaſing to God. For as ſweet odours are a refreſhing of the ſenſes, ſo our refreſhing of the Saints bowels, is in a manner a refreſhing of Gods own ſenſe and Spirit. A term borrowed from the perfumes which were made upon the Altar of Incenſe. I ſhall add further, but that in, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 41.1, 2, 3. which I judge very pertinent to the thing in hand; <hi>Bleſſed is he that conſidereth the poor, the Lord will deliver him in time of trouble; The Lord will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him and keep him alive, and he ſhall be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

The Lord ſhall under-prop him upon his ſick bed, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his bed of faintneſs, weakneſs, feebleneſs; yea, make his bed in his ſickneſs, or change his bed, which may admit of this two-fold ſence. As if he had ſaid, ſpeaking in a prophetical manner; Thou, O God, ſhalt as ſurely turn his ſickneſs to the beſt, as if I ſaw it already performed. Or thus, thou ſhalt ſupply all humane helps unto him, that is uſed to be beſtowed upon ſick, diſeaſed and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered perſons.</p>

He wiſhes them, as they would be ſure of their Election, and have a ſound note or mark of their holineſs, and that God loved them to be putting on bowels of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; as if he had ſaid, let theſe be your robes and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verings, wear them as you wear your garments; let them be as tender and inward unto you, as your own principal and moſt vital parts.

               <p n="7">7ly. The ſeventh and laſt Soveraign Receipt, for the prevention or curing of this Peſtilential diſeaſe; <hi>Is an Evangelical univerſal obedience to the Goſpel of Chriſt:</hi> Called by the Apoſtle in <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.26. <hi>The obedience of Faith,</hi> conſiſting in a readineſs to do the Will of God, in things commanded or forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, be they never ſo troubleſome or contrary to our reaſon or liking. I call it <hi>Evangelical,</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh it from that which is <hi>Legal;</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired an abſolute univerſal conformity, not of our actions only, but of our affections alſo to the will of God, exactly in every point and title there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, upon pain of Eternal Damnation, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10, 13. And therefore by the Apoſtle called, <hi>The miniſtration of death and condemnation,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7, 9. This Evangelical Obedience, conſiſts in beleiving the Goſpel, and ſubjecting our ſelves thereunto; whence it is, that it is put for faith
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:66159:123"/>
or the receiving of the Goſpel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.8. Comp. with <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.19. and to obey Chriſt, for belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5. and to obey the truth for beleiving the Doctrine of the Goſpel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.22. Which evangelical or Goſpel obedience is to be performed unto God, in and through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who as he is held forth to be the pattern of our obedience, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.1. So is he the Author of eternal ſalvation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all them that obey him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. And through his obedience onely it is that we are made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. This I ſay does conſiſt in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and chearfulneſs to do the will of God. <hi>Lo I come</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>to do thy Will O God,</hi> Heb. 10.7. <hi>My meat is to do the will of him that ſent me, and to finiſh his work,</hi> Joh. 4.34. And it muſt be performed from the heart, out of love unto Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17. Upon this hing all Goſpel obedience hangs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.10. This is the ſpring from whence it originally flows, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. The love of Chriſt conſtraineth us; The force and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of which will make difficult things eaſie; The Saints loved not their lives unto the death, for the love they bore unto Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.11. Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob <hi>ſerved ſeven years for</hi> Rachel, <hi>and</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>they ſeemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had unto her, Gen.</hi> 29.20. <hi>Charity ſuffereth long and is kind, it beareth all things, beleiveth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.4, 7. <hi>Much water cannot quench it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the floods drown it,</hi> Cant. 8.7. When the ſoul is mounted upon the wings of faith and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it makes it like the Chariots of <hi>Aminadib,</hi> Cant. 6.12. It will make the ſoul cleave unto Chriſt,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:66159:123"/>
as <hi>Ruth</hi> unto <hi>Naomi</hi> her Mother-in-law, not to leave him, nor return from following after him. It will ſay then unto Chriſt, <hi>Whither thou goeſt I will go; and where thou lodgeſt, I will lodge; thy people, ſhall be my people; and thy God, my God; where thou dieſt, will I dye; and there will I be buried; the Lord do ſo to me, and more alſo, if ought but death part thee and me,</hi> Ruth 1.16, 17. Lord if thou goeſt into a Priſon, ſaith the gratious, loving beleiving, obeying ſoul, I will go with thee; if thou lodgeſt there in a Dungeon, I will lodge with thee; I am reſolved in thy ſtrength not to leave thee, go where thou wilt; It will ſay as <hi>Paul, None of theſe things ſhall move me, nor ſhall I count my life dear unto my ſelf, ſo that I may but finiſh my courſe with joy; and the miniſtery which I have received of the Lord Jeſus, to teſtifie the Goſpel of the grace of God,</hi> Act. 20.24. <hi>Mount-Sion</hi> Saints will follow the Lamb whither-ſoever he goeth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.4. They have an inſeperable communion, an individual ſociety with the Lamb, which referred to the ſtate of their warfare, notes the ſincerity and conſtancy of their faith and obedience under Anti-chriſts perſecution; they follow not the Beaſt, but the Lamb, whereſoever he goeth, that is, they exactly walk in the precepts and ſteps of the lamb, whereſoever he leadeth them, &amp; he leadeth them to the Fountains of living waters, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.17. Theſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers not the decres and Idols of the Beaſt to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded upon them, but wholly cleave to Chriſt their guide, and like <hi>Caleb</hi> &amp; <hi>Joſhua,</hi> they will follow him fully, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.24. This indeed is very difficult in it ſelf, and in our ſtrength ſo to do. Our own experience tells us, that Goſpel obedience is an
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:66159:124"/>
up-hill way, and its hard to get a great waight up an hill; therefore when the Apoſtle preſſeth Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-obedience, he bids us lay aſide every weight, that we may run with patience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1. The old <hi>Adam</hi> is a clogg to our obedience, and weights eaſily pull us down; and if down, to riſe again, it is up-hill work.</p>
               <p>What a do have we to get up our hearts unto true Goſpel-ſorrow for our ſins? Oh, what a hard work it is to bring our hearts up to a beleif of the promiſes? to truſt God in difficulties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oh, how difficult to get up the hill of Goſpel-obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? what pains muſt we take to get to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God in the Spirit? Gods call for our obedience, is like his command to <hi>Moſes,</hi> Deut. 32.49, 50. <hi>Go up to</hi> Mount Nebo, <hi>and dye there.</hi> So, go up into thy Cloſet, and kill thy corruptions there, let thy deareſt luſts dye there, pluck out thy right eye there, and cut off thy right hand there; and we had as live dy, as do ſuch a thing, ſuch verily is our natural ſtubbornneſs againſt God.</p>
               <p>When God bids us up and do this, or that; oh, how irkſome and unpleaſing is it to fleſh and blood. When the Goſpel bids us look above all things; Father, Mother, Wife, Children, Lands, Houſes, Life; and and leave, forſake and hate them all, and then thou ſhalt be a Diſciple of Chriſt, upon the account of Goſpel-obedience. Are we not ready to ſay with thoſe Diſciples of Chriſt, <hi>This is a hard ſaying, who can bear it?</hi> Joh. 6.60. Yet I ſay, the ſoul that is carried upon the wings of faith and love, and ſtrengthened with might by the Spirit of the Lord in the inward man, can chearfully and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly conform to ſuch harſh, difficult and unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:66159:124"/>
commands, conſidered as to fleſh and blood.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall come a little cloſer as to the thing in hand, to excite thee to this evangelical obedience.</p>
               <p>Conſider firſt, how acceptable and well-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a thing it is unto the Lord, in that he prefers it above legal Sacrifices whatſoever. As <hi>Sumuel</hi> ſaid to <hi>Saul, Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt-offerings and Sacrifices, as in obeying the voyce of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better then Sacrifice, and to hearken then the fat of rams. For rebellion is as the ſin of witch-craft, and ſtubbornneſs is as iniquity and Idolatry,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.22, 23. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.6. So <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.22, 23. <hi>For I ſpake not unto your Fathers, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them in the day that I brought them out of the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>concerning burnt-offerings and ſacrifices; But this thing commanded I them,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye ſhall be my people, and walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well with you. But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in the counſels and imaginations of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward, &amp;c.</hi> And becauſe they rejected the Lords Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, he ſent among them, and would not hearken unto the Lord, nor incline their ear, but hardned their neck, and did worſe then their Fathers; Therefore the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> was to ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, <hi>This is a Nation that obeyeth not the voice of the Lord their God, nor receiveth correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, truth is periſhed, and is cut off from their mouth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But did not the Lord command their Burnt-offerings and Sacrifices after he had brought them out of the Land of <hi>Egypt?</hi> were they not things of his own appointment?</p>

                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:66159:125"/>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yea, Surely the Lord did command and injoyn their ſacrifices, and it was their ſin to omit them; but the meaning is this, as if the Lord had ſaid, This was not the chiefeſt thing that I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them, as ye Hypocrites do conceive and imagine, but it was their ſincere obedience, which they have not yeilded unto me, and you have yeild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me leſs then they; I did expect that your fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers ſhould have obeyed my voice in all other things that I had enjoyned and commanded them to do, as well as in matters of burnt-offerings and ſacrifices, but ſeeing they diſobeyed my voice, and yet would come and ſacrifice unto me with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure hands, and unclean hearts, rebellious and diſobedient ſpirits, their Sacrifices and Offerings to me were as if I had not commanded them at all, my ſoul did loath them and abominate them, and ſo they do yours, ſo long as you hearken not to my voice, but walk in the counſells and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of your own evil hearts. The Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> gives much light into this underſtanding of the mind of God, in <hi>Hoſea</hi> 6.6. and ſo doe; our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour, referring his ſpeech thereunto; <hi>For I deſire mercy, and not ſacrifice, and the knowledge of God, more then burnt-offerings,</hi> See <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.13. <hi>and</hi> 12.7. that is, I preferred works of mercy, before Sacrifice, and the knowledge of God, as it is joyned with obedience to the will of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore burnt-offering. The outward bare offering; conſidered in it ſelf, without faith and repentance, the Lord highly reproved and rejected; See to this purpoſe, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 50.12, to 17. So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.11, to 15. See there how the Lord did abominate their offerings, notwithſtanding he had inſtituted and
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:66159:125"/>
appointed them. <hi>To what purpoſe is the multitude of your ſacrifices unto me?</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>I am full of the burnt-offerings of Rams, &amp;c. bring no more vain oblations, incenſe is an abomination unto me, the new Moons and Sabbaths, the calling of Aſſemblies,</hi> I <hi>cannot away with; it is iniquity, even your ſolemn meeting, your new Moons, and your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed feaſts, my ſoul hateth, they are a trouble unto me, I am weary to bear them. And when ye ſpread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you; yea, when ye make many prayers I will not hear:</hi> And why? <hi>Your bands are full of blood, will ye kill and murder my ſervants the Prophets, and ſhed the blood of mine innocent ones? and come and think to appeaſe my wrath with your hypocritical offerings?</hi> And therefore he exhorts them to repentance; <hi>Waſh ye, make ye clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes, ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well, ſeek judgment, releive the oppreſſed, judge the fatherleſs, plead for the widow; Come now and let us reaſon to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather, ſaith the Lord; when theſe things are done, then come unto me, then bring your offerings unto me, then ſhall they be accepted by me, then we will reaſon together, then I will hear your prayers, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don your ſins, and not before.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it is, that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaies, <hi>The ſacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord, but the prayer of the upright is his delight,</hi> Prov. 15.8.

thereby; and as it were calling upon God to be an help to advance and ſet forward, their villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and miſchievous deſignes; As <hi>Balaam</hi> and <hi>Balaack</hi> did, <hi>Numb.</hi> 23. <hi>Will ye ſteal murder, and commit adultery, and ſwear falſly, and burn incenſe unto</hi> Baal, <hi>and walk after other Gods whom ye know not,</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>And come and ſtand before me in this houſe, which is called by my name, and ſay, we are delivered to do all theſe abominations,</hi> Jer. 7.9, 10. As if the Lord had ſaid, are ye not aſhamed to deal ſo hypocritically and wickedly. I do as much eſteem of ſuch ſervices and ſacrifices, as the cutting off of a Dogs neck, or the offering of Swinesblood: as his expreſſion is, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.3. I accept not of ſuch offerings; <hi>Take away from me the noyſe of thy ſongs, for I will not hear the melady of thy Violls; But let judgment run down as waters, and righteouſneſs as a mighty ſtream,</hi> Amos 5.22, 23, 24. Their vocal and inſtrumental muſick, was at that time a part of Gods inſtituted outward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but by them corrupted together with the reſt, through their hipocriſie and wickedneſs, and eſpecially through their heinous Idolatry, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they abuſed their Muſick, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.3. <hi>The ſongs of the Temple ſhall be howling in that day;</hi> I wiſh theſe things might be rightly conſidered, and applyed in this day; I am afraid; there is ſuch kind of ſervice and worſhip performed now adays, which will come under the ſharp rebuke and reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Lord; ſuch as God will abominate, and eſpecially if the ſame be offered with a wicked mind. To cry up the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord, the Church of God, the Houſe of God, &amp;c. Will be but a truſting in
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:66159:126"/>
lying words, if the men of this generation do not throughly amend their ways and their doings. This will not priviledge them, nor deliver them to do all thoſe dreadful abominations, as are perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated and acted in theſe times. God will ſay, take from me the noyſe of your Songs, or Singing-men, &amp; I will not hear the melady of your Organs. They are to me but as the howling of a Dog; So on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, for ſuch as are in a congregational way, &amp; have ſeperated from the publique national worſhip. Let them take heed that they reſt not in the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal part of Gods worſhip in outward ordinances, and Church-fellowſhips, and ſo grow ſecure, and formal and carnal, heartleſs and ſpiritleſs, and think they have a diſpenſation hereby for any cloſe hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie or iniquity. I would let ſuch know, that if they are not in the life and ſpirit of ordinances, in the ſpirit of faith and prayer, and a holy commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints, beautified with a practical, holy, humble, heavenly, fruitful Goſpel converſation, that they ſin againſt the Lord, and be ſure their ſin will find them out, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Reube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi> and <hi>Gadites,</hi> Numb. 32.23. I ſay it is Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Obedience that is ſo acceptable unto him. <hi>As obedient children, not faſhioning your ſelves accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the former luſts in your ignorance; but as he which hath called you is holy, ſo be ye holy in all manner of converſation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.14, 15. And that it is ſo well pleaſing a thing unto the Lord, and of ſuch ſpecial efficacy and force, to ſtay or divert the Judgments of God from falling upon a Nation or people; that pathetical, or rather paternal wiſh of the Lord, ſeems to imply ſo much, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 81.13, to the end. <hi>O that my people
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:66159:127"/>
had hearkened unto me, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>had walked in my ways;</hi> What then? <hi>I ſhould ſoon have ſubdued their enemies, and turned my hand againſt their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries; The haters of the Lord ſhould have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted themſelves unto him; but their time ſhould have endured for ever. He ſhould have fed them alſo with the fineſt of the Wheat, and with honey out of the rock ſhould I have ſatisfied thee.</hi> What an ardent deſire of the Lord was here, as to his peoples hearkening unto him, and walking in his ways, and ſee what the Lord would have done for them thereupon; He would have ſubdued their enemies, and ſo conſequently procured their peace; As <hi>Nathan</hi> told <hi>David,</hi> that they ſhould dwell in a place of their own, and move no more, and that the children of wickedneſs ſhould not afflict them any more, as before time, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.10. He would have turned his hand againſt their Adverſaries; What's that? the hand of his Plagues and puniſhments; he would have taken off his Plagues and Puniſhments from them, and laid them upon his adverſaries; ſo ſaid <hi>Job, Withdraw thine hand from me, and let not thy dread make me afraid,</hi> Job 13.21. that is, <hi>put thy Plague and viſitation far from me,</hi> So <hi>Judges</hi> 2.15. It is thus rendred. <hi>Whither-ſoever they went out, the hand of the Lord was againſt them for evil,</hi> as the Lord had ſaid, and as the Lord had ſworn unto them, and they were greatly diſtreſſed, and what hand was this, but his ſore judgments, and among the reſt, this of the deſtroying Peſtilence, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.25. which he threatned ſhould cleave unto them, until he had conſumed them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.21. So in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.6, 11. It is ſaid, the hand of the Lord
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:66159:127"/>
was heavy upon the men of <hi>Aſhdod,</hi> and he deſtroyed them, and ſmote them with <hi>Emerods,</hi> See alſo, <hi>Ruth</hi> 1.13. <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.8, 9. and <hi>Act.</hi> 13.11. The haters of the Lord ſhould have ſubmitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, thoſe that oppreſſed them, ſhould have ſubjected unto them, either willingly, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrainedly, chooſe them whether. But their time ſhould have endured for ever; his peoples time, the time of their proſperity and flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſtate ſhould have endured for ever; The meaning is, they ſhould have had and enjoyed a long bleſſed and happy life. He would have fed them alſo with the fineſt of the Wheat, with the fat of the Wheat, the Flower of it, or the beſt and chiefeſt Corn, they ſhould have had what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was beſt for the maintenance of their life, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 18.12. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.14. and <hi>Pſa.</hi> 147.14. <hi>He maketh peace in thy borders, and filleſt thee with the fineſt of the wheat;</hi> And what more? With honey out of the Rock ſhould I have ſatisfied thee, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.13. The Bees in the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> uſed much to harbour in the rocks. But ſpiritually this rock doth ſignifie Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. and the honey, that ſweetneſs of ſpeech, and thoſe ſavoury and gracious words, which did iſſue from his mouth, being ſweetneſs to the ſoul, and health to the bones, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 19.10. <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.24. <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.11. Noting by this manner of ſpeech, that they ſhould have had all things, both pleaſant and profitable for the maintenance of their life, if their wickedneſs and diſobedience had not ſtopped the courſe of his goodneſs and mercy. Take that concurrent place alſo, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.18, 19. <hi>O that thou hadſt hearkened to my Commandements,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:66159:128"/>
then had thy peace been as a River, and thy righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as the waves of the Sea; thy ſeed alſo had been as the ſand, and the off-ſpring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof, his name ſhould not have been cut off, nor deſtroyed from before me.</hi> What a promiſe was here alſo upon the account of their obedience? their peace or proſperity rather ſhould have been as a River, that is abounding and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways laſting, as a River floweth continually and ſtoppeth not; And their righteouſneſs as the waves of the Sea; that is, the bleſſed and happy eſtate of their Government; as the fruit of their righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; ſhould as the Waves of the Sea, been exceeding abundant, flowing and flouriſhing; and their ſeed ſhould have been as the Sand of the Sea for multitude; So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.12. <hi>If ye be willing and obedient, ye ſhall eat the good of the Land; But if ye refuſe and rebel, ye ſhall be devoured with the ſword; If ye obey my commandements, ye ſhall eat the beſt things of the Land,</hi> Job 21.25 So <hi>Elihu</hi> in his ſpeech to <hi>Job, If they obey and ſerve him, they ſhall ſpend their days in proſperity, and their years in pleaſures; But if they obey not, they ſhall periſh by the ſword, and they ſhall dye without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> Job 36.11, 12. See alſo, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.13. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.3. <hi>and</hi> 11.22. <hi>and</hi> 26.27. <hi>and</hi> 28.15. What promiſes the Lord made upon the account of their obedience. More particularly to the thing in hand, that in <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.12, 13, 14, 15. Is worthy of our beſt obſervation, where among many other things which the Lord promiſed as great and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular bleſſings upon that ſcore, this is not the leaſt nor meaneſt; <hi>The Lord will take away from thee all ſickneſs, and will put none of the evil diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:66159:128"/>
of</hi> Egypt <hi>upon thee, but will lay them upon all them that hate thee.</hi> What the evil diſeaſes of <hi>Egypt</hi> were, is well known to moſt; This of the noyſom deſtroying Peſtilence being one, <hi>Amos</hi> 4.10. Let me add two or three places more in the New Teſtament, and then I ſhall draw to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciuſion; <hi>John</hi> 8.12. <hi>I am the light of the World,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>he that followeth me, ſhall not walk in darkneſs, but ſhall have the light of life; He that embraceth my Doctrine with a true faith, and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſame, ſhall not walk in the darkneſs of error and ſin, but ſhall have the light of life to bring him to everlaſting life;</hi> So <hi>John</hi> 12.26. <hi>If any man ſerve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there ſhall alſo my ſervant be; if any man ſerve me, him will my Father honour;</hi> Can that man be in a miſerable or uncomfortable condition to be where Chriſt ſhall be? and what honour can be comparable to that which God the Father ſhall confer upon thoſe who ſerve the Lord Chriſt? I ſhall only add, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.14. <hi>Bleſſed are they that do his commandements, that they may have right to the Tree of Life, and may enter in through the gates into the City,</hi> to wit, <hi>of the new and Heavenly Jeruſalem, which deſcendeth out of Heaven from God, and commeth down from God out of Heaven, prepared as a Bride adorned for her Husband,</hi> Rev. 21.2. Whereof ſee the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. And what this Tree of life is, See <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.2. By this Tree of life is meant the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; Fitly called the Tree of life, in reſpect of his vivifying, conferring, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving life unto them that eat thereof, which is but one; though he is ſaid to ſtand in the midſt of the ſtreet, and of either ſide of the River,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:66159:129"/>
that is, his leaves and roots, is on both ſides of the River, ſo that there is no want on either ſide. Hence Chriſt ſaid, <hi>to him that overcometh, I will give to eat of the Tree of Life, which is in the midſt of the Paradiſe of God.</hi> This I ſay is Chriſt himſelf, the Fountain and Author of our life; The Bread of Life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.51. The Water of Life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.7. The Reſurrection and Life it ſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.25. And he ſtands by the River, becauſe he never withereth, or is fruitleſs. A Tree planted by the Rivers of waters, is always green and fruitful; Chriſt alone is ſufficient for life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all, and to quicken all his elect for ever and ever. This Tree hath twelve manner of fruits, and yeildeth her fruit every moneth, and the leaves of the Tree are for the healing of the Nations; What does this hold forth, but the quickening vertue of Chriſts merits and ſpirit, which is vigorous and efficatious throughout the whole year; that is, for ever and ever, to preſerve al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways this ſpiritual life, and this bleſſed refreſhing, for the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, without any weakening or enſeebling, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.16. And mark in the cloſe of this diſcourſe, that the leaves of this Tree have a medicinal uſe for to preſerve the health of the Nations; Not that there ſhall be any infirmities any more in the New <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but that the healing of all infirmities which was wrought here by the merits and ſpirit of Chriſt, ſhall be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the ſame power for ever kept and preſerved inviolate for all beleivers. See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47.12.</p>
               <p>Now bleſſed are they that do his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as touching, the not worſhipping of the Beaſt and his Image, the forſaking of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:66159:129"/>
the faithful following of the Lamb, ſubjecting and ſubmitting to all his holy, heavenly, pure, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical inſtitutions, appointments, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, patiently and chearfully ſuffering for his ſake, in bearing witneſs unto the truth, if called thereunto, perſevering in the grace of Chriſt; doing juſtly, loving mercy, and walking humbly with God, ſuch ſhall have right to this Tree of Life, and enter in through the gates into the City. They ſhall have a right of enjoying Chriſt and his unſpeakable benefits, and be perpetual and moſt happy Inhabitants of the heavenly <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem;</hi> And he that ſitteth on the throne ſhall dwell among them. <hi>They ſhall hunger no more, neither thirſt any more, neither ſhall the Sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb which is in the midſt of the throne ſhall feed them, and ſhall lead them unto living fountains of water; and God ſhall wipe away all tears from their eyes,</hi> Rev. 7.15, 16, 17. I ſhall add no more, but that of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy, Conſider what I ſay, and the Lord give thee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in all things,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.7.</p>
